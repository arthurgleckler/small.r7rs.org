The [[http://www.scheme-reports.org/][R7RS Working Group 1]] produced the R7RS Small standard ([[https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf][PDF]]) of
Scheme in 2013.  I was one of the members of the working group.

We used a [[https://trac.edgewall.org/][Trac]] instance to keep track of all of our work.  Trac
provides a wiki, a ticketing system, etc.  We used it to track
remaining work, to collect votes, to publish and revise proposals,
etc.  Our Trac server was at [[http://trac.sacrideo.us/][trac.sacrideo.us]], and was hosted by Aaron
Hsu.

In 2019, we didn't want to maintain a Trac server any more, but we
didn't want to lose the record of all of our work on R7RS Small.  I
wrote [[file:trac.scm][trac.scm]] to convert our Trac instance's Sqlite database into the
static web site now hosted at [[https://small.r7rs.org/][small.r7rs.org]].  I made it just good
enough to extract our data in a usable form once and for all.

Normally, it's not a good idea to include generated output in a Git
repo.  However, in this case, my plan was to run the code here once,
produce the output, and be done.  I'm not maintaining the code, so
it's better to keep a copy of the output just in.  So the output is in
[[file:output/][output/]], and the attachments, including the final R7RS Small report,
are in [[file:trac-attachments][trac-attachments/]].

I plan to publish the Trac database backup at [[https://files.scheme.org/][files.scheme.org]].
