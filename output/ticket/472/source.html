    <h2>description</h2>
    <pre>In items #91, #148 and #150 we voted to allow the
use of `include`, `include-ci` and `cond-expand`
at the &quot;top-level&quot; respectively, but there remains
some confusion as to their semantics.

Here &quot;top-level&quot; refers to repl and program body
top-levels, but not library bodies.

One interpretation is that these behave like library
declarations, and can expand into `import` forms.
In this case, for a purely static implementation of
R7RS libraries, they must first be statically scanned
from all top-level forms.  They cannot be used
outside the top-level, and are not even available
as bindings otherwise.  This is the `declaration`
proposal.

Another interpretation is that they are just normal
macros with the obvious definitions (cond-expand
in terms of the output of the `features` procedure),
are available in the `(scheme base)` library, and
consequently can't be used to expand into `import`
since imports have already been resolved.  This is
the `syntax` proposal.

Alternately, we could provide `both`.  If you think
this is all too confusing you could also vote `remove`,
to drop these extensions.

Related is the matter of whether multiple `import`
forms are allowed in programs or only one may
allowed as in R6RS.  With either `syntax` or `remove`
it could make sense to add this restriction, so the
`/single-import` variant is provided.
Note the repl allows allows multiple `import` forms.

    <h2>newvalue</h2>
    <pre>WG1 voted to accept the `syntax` alternative.  As a result, `include`, `include-ci`, and `cond-expand` become normal syntax keywords in the `(scheme base)` library as well as being library declarations.  They are no longer special either at the REPL or in top-level programs.

At least the first two cannot be expressed as `syntax-rules` macros using only portable procedures, and so must be described as new primitive expression types in Section 4.1.</pre>
