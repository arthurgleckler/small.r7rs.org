        <p>In items <a href="/ticket/91">#91</a>, <a href="/ticket/148">#148</a> and <a href="/ticket/150">#150</a> we voted to allow the
use of <span class="monospace">include</span>, <span class="monospace">include-ci</span> and <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span>
at the &quot;top-level&quot; respectively, but there remains
some confusion as to their semantics.</p>
        <p>Here &quot;top-level&quot; refers to repl and program body
top-levels, but not library bodies.</p>
        <p>One interpretation is that these behave like library
declarations, and can expand into <span class="monospace">import</span> forms.
In this case, for a purely static implementation of
R7RS libraries, they must first be statically scanned
from all top-level forms.  They cannot be used
outside the top-level, and are not even available
as bindings otherwise.  This is the <span class="monospace">declaration</span>
proposal.</p>
        <p>Another interpretation is that they are just normal
macros with the obvious definitions (cond-expand
in terms of the output of the <span class="monospace">features</span> procedure),
are available in the <span class="monospace">(scheme base)</span> library, and
consequently can't be used to expand into <span class="monospace">import</span>
since imports have already been resolved.  This is
the <span class="monospace">syntax</span> proposal.</p>
        <p>Alternately, we could provide <span class="monospace">both</span>.  If you think
this is all too confusing you could also vote <span class="monospace">remove</span>,
to drop these extensions.</p>
        <p>Related is the matter of whether multiple <span class="monospace">import</span>
forms are allowed in programs or only one may
allowed as in R6RS.  With either <span class="monospace">syntax</span> or <span class="monospace">remove</span>
it could make sense to add this restriction, so the
<span class="monospace">/single-import</span> variant is provided.
Note the repl allows allows multiple <span class="monospace">import</span> forms.</p></div>

              <p>WG1 voted to accept the <span class="monospace">syntax</span> alternative.  As a result, <span class="monospace">include</span>, <span class="monospace">include-ci</span>, and <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> become normal syntax keywords in the <span class="monospace">(scheme base)</span> library as well as being library declarations.  They are no longer special either at the REPL or in top-level programs.</p>
              <p>At least the first two cannot be expressed as <span class="monospace">syntax-rules</span> macros using only portable procedures, and so must be described as new primitive expression types in Section 4.1.</p></div></div></div>
