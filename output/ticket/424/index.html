        <p>For binary-ports there are the procedures <span class="monospace">write-u8</span> and <span class="monospace">write-bytevector</span>.

It may be argued that <span class="monospace">display</span> already provides this, however it is in a library that is optional. Strings written with <span class="monospace">write-string</span> are not enclosed in double quotes, and no characters are escaped within those strings. Change <span class="monospace">display</span> procedure for strings to say that they are written as if by <span class="monospace">write-string</span>.</p></div>
