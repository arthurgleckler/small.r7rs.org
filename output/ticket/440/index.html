Relevant draft: r7rs draft 6</p>
        <p>Type: defect
Priority: major
Relevant section of draft: 6.13.3. Output</p>
        <p>Summary: Write procedure is not backwards compatible</p>
        <p>R7RS introduces a new output procedure called write-simple, which has
the same semantics as the R5RS write procedure.  On the other hand,
the R7RS write procedure handles shared structures differently than
the R5RS.  For example :</p>
        <p>(let ((x (list 1 2))) (write (list x x)))</p>
        <p>displays ((1 2) (1 2)) in an R5RS system
   and displays (<a href="/ticket/0">#0</a>=(1 2) <a href="/ticket/0">#0</a>#) in an R7RS system</p>
        <p>To preserve backwards compatibility, it is the version of the write
procedure which uses datum labels which should have a different name.
In fact SRFI-38 has specified the name write-with-shared-structure for
this output procedure.  This name should be maintained since it has
been implemented with that name in some Scheme systems.</p></div>

              <p>After further discussion with Marc and evaluating Scheme implementations, I think that we have a valid problem here. On the one hand, we have the desire to be able to preserve datum equivalence across a read and a write, on the other the desire to make certain writes produce valid code. Finally, we have the third desire not to make <span class="monospace">write</span> unstable.</p>
              <p>I propose that we can actually do this all with a single procedure <span class="monospace">write</span> and a parameter <span class="monospace">print-graph</span>. When <span class="monospace">print-graph</span> is <span class="monospace">#f</span> then <span class="monospace">write</span> has the traditional semantics, where the behavior on cycles is undefined -- particularly, Schemes may print cycles, or they may infinite loop, but in the non-cycle case, they print the simple structure, and do not preserve shared structure. When <span class="monospace">print-graph</span> is <span class="monospace">#t</span> then <span class="monospace">write</span> must print out the datum preserving shared structure.</p>
              <p>The above allows <span class="monospace">write</span> to be backwards compatible, but still enables implementations to implement it safely if they wish to, to handle cycles, but still gives us a way to print shared structure.</p>
              <p>I think it is important to provide a safe, default, backwards compatible version of <span class="monospace">write</span>. In that vein, I would want to require implementations that support shared structure to enable <span class="monospace">print-graph</span> implicitly when a cycle is detected.</p>
              <p>Another option is to have <span class="monospace">write/shared</span> on the one hand, but then make <span class="monospace">write</span> use <span class="monospace">write/shared</span> whenever a cycle is detected if the implementation provides it. However, this creates some problems for folks who might want a <span class="monospace">write</span> that would infinite loop. The question is whether this is worth it at all?</p>
              <p>Using the parameter is more flexible, as it allows us to add an additional switch, where we could say that if <span class="monospace">print-graph</span> is <span class="monospace">'cycle</span> then it will detect cycles, but if it is <span class="monospace">#f</span> it will not, and could infinite loop.</p>
              <p>I think the question comes down to whether we want to require the handling of cycles or not.</p></div></div></div>
