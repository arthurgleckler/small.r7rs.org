        <p>R5RS sometimes places the domain conditions of a procedure before its explanation.  For example, <span class="monospace">map</span> is defined thus:</p>
        <p>The <i>lists</i> must be lists, and <i>proc</i> must be a procedure taking as many arguments as there are <i>lists</i> and returning a single value. If more than one <i>list</i> is given, then they must all be the same length. <span class="monospace">Map</span> applies <i>proc</i> element-wise to the elements of the <i>lists</i> and returns a list of the results, in order. The dynamic order in which <i>proc</i> is applied to the elements of the <i>lists</i> is unspecified.</p>
        <p>The equivalent language in R7RS draft 6 says:</p>
        <p>It is an error if <i>proc</i> does not accept as many arguments as there are <i>lists</i> and return a single value.  The <span class="monospace">map</span> procedure applies <i>proc</i> element-wise to the elements of the <i>lists</i> and returns a list of the results, in order.  If more than one <i>list</i> is given and not all lists have the same length, <span class="monospace">map</span> terminates when the shortest list runs out.  It is an error for <i>proc</i> to mutate any of the lists.  The dynamic order in which <i>proc</i> is applied to the elements of the <i>lists</i> is unspecified.  If multiple returns occur from <span class="monospace">map</span>, the values returned by earlier returns are not mutated.</p>
        <p>Note that the statement that the <i>lists</i> must be lists has been removed, being subsumed by the list of naming conventions in 1.3.3.</p>
        <p>Cowan thinks this paragraph would be more readable if the purpose of <span class="monospace">map</span> appeared first, as this is the topic sentence, thus:</p>
        <p>The <span class="monospace">map</span> procedure applies <i>proc</i> element-wise to the elements of the <i>lists</i> and returns a list of the results, in order.  If more than one <i>list</i> is given and not all lists have the same length, <span class="monospace">map</span> terminates when the shortest list runs out.  It is an error if <i>proc</i> does not accept as many arguments as there are <i>lists</i> and return a single value.  It is also an error for <i>proc</i> to mutate any of the lists.  The dynamic order in which <i>proc</i> is applied to the elements of the <i>lists</i> is unspecified.  If multiple returns occur from <span class="monospace">map</span>, the values returned by earlier returns are not mutated.</p>
        <p>Shinn disagrees and insists on a vote, although there is no difference in substance.</p></div>

              <p>The WG voted to reject this proposal and leave the domain information in place, but to separate the additional domain restrictions from the initial description, as a separate short paragraph immediately following the prototype, possibly de-emphasized by making it smaller. This would keep the domain in one place and still allow the first line of the description stand out prominently in the initial paragraph.</p></div></div></div>
