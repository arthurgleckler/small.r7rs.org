              <p>Why is this restricted to accessors when its title speaks of identifiers generally?  Surely the same issue arises with conflicts between modifiers, or between an accessor and a modifier.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>I have adjusted the language to allow for both accessors and mutators. What I wanted to distinguish was the issue where you want to bind two different procedures to the same name, and where you have two field names that were the same, which shouldn't cause a problem since they are not used anywhere.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>This is <b>JUST WRONG</b>, and has been corrected repeatedly.  Field names are used in the definition of a SRFI 9 constructor.  Consider this:</p><span class="monospace">  (define-record-type :pare
    (kons x x)
    pare?
    (x kar set-kar!)
    (x kdr))
</span>
              <p>Which argument of <span class="monospace">kons</span> is identified with which field?  Field types have to be distinct identifiers (not merely distinct symbols), though technically they don't have to be distinct from accessor/modifier names.</p></div></div></div>
