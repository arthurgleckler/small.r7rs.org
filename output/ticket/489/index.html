              <p>It's a matter of opinion whether Scheme's procedure library (which is greatly extended by the draft) is an instance of diamond-like beauty in <i>any</i> version of the Scheme standard.  It is for the most part ad hoc and historical, both in the kinds of data structures dealt with, and the particular procedures provided.  I believe that the truly gem-like part of IEEE/R4RS/R5RS Scheme is the treatment of control structures, which is far superior to almost all of its successors; the core of Scheme would be unaffected (modulo the use of lists to represent multiple arguments) if all the data structures and procedures were changed completely.</p>
              <p>Standardizers, however, are not gem-cutters: their concern is and must be with practical utility as well as beauty.</p></div></div></div>
