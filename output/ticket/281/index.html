        <p>Currently, it's undefined what happens if the first argument to <span class="monospace">eval</span> is a list containing objects which have no datum representation, such as procedures, records, the end of file object, and so on.  I propose that we require <span class="monospace">eval</span> to treat all these objects as self-quoting.  In particular, that means that a list whose car is a procedure (as opposed to an expression which evaluates to a procedure) is evaluated as a function call.</p>
        <p>I tested this last case on my usual battery of Schemes.  Racket, Bigloo, Guile, Kawa, SISC, Larceny, STklos, SigScheme, Elk, UMB, VX were able to evaluate a list with the <span class="monospace">cons</span> procedure in the car.  Gauche, Gambit, Chicken, Scheme48/scsh, Chibi, Chez, SCM, Ikarus, Ypsilon, Mosh, IronScheme rejected it; however, only Scheme48/scsh had a problem with <i>quoted</i> procedure objects.</p>
        <p>I was not able to test MIT, KSi, Scheme 9, Scheme 7, Oaklisp due to difficulties with their <span class="monospace">eval</span> procedures (Scheme 9 has none).</p></div>

              <p>Given the loud complaints about this, and the fact that the quoted version works in all Schemes but one, I am withdrawing this ticket.</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
