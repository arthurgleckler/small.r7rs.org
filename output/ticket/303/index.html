delay and force were simple balanced concepts, but the
introduction of lazy somewhat confuses the issue - when
is delay appropriate and when is lazy?  A simple solution
would be to rename lazy to delay-force, indicating it is
simply the composition of delay and force, and letting
people see directly in code the balance of delays and forces.

The eager procedure is named particularly unfortunately
because it sounds as though it is in some way paired with
lazy, and there is anecdotal evidence it was voted in on
this misunderstanding.  In fact, it is completed unrelated
to lazy, being just a utility procedure that has never been
seen used in practice.  Perhaps a better name for it would
be promise, since it just creates an (already computed)
promise value.

`delay` and `force` were simple balanced concepts, but the introduction of `lazy` somewhat confuses the issue - when is `delay` appropriate and when is `lazy`?  A simple solution would be to rename `lazy` to `delay-force`, indicating it is simply the composition of `delay` and `force`, and letting people see directly in code the balance of `delay`s and `force`s.
