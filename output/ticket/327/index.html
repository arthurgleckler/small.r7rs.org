Proposed language (from Vincent Manis):

The lexical syntax for numbers accepted by string-&gt;number and read, and the corresponding syntax in programs must be the same.

In the alternative, we should at least say the relationship is unspecified.</span><span class="new-value">Currently there is no guarantee of this.

Possibilities:

''All the same'': The lexical syntax for numbers accepted by `string-&gt;number` and `read`, as well as the corresponding syntax of literal numbers in programs, must be the same.

''All the same at run time'': The lexical syntax for numbers accepted by `string-&gt;number` and `read` must be the same, but the relationship with the the corresponding syntax of literal numbers in programs is unspecified.

''All potentially different'': The relationships between lexical syntax for numbers accepted by `string-&gt;number` and `read`, as well as the corresponding syntax of literal numbers in programs, is unspecified.</span></div></div>

              <p>More from Vincent:</p>
              <p>The syntactic issues relate to such things as whether S, F, D, and L are valid (&quot;the implementation <i>may</i> accept...&quot;, p. 32). Pragmatic issues include whether integer or other literals might overflow (on a bignum-less implementation), whether or not the implementation applies the same restrictions, described at the bottom of p. 37) to <span class="monospace">string-&gt;number</span>, <span class="monospace">read</span>, and literals in source programs; the default precision if the E exponent marker is used; and numerical roundoff on input conversion (whether, e.g., <span class="monospace">(= (string-&gt;number? 0.1) 0.1)</span> is defined to be true).</p>
              <p>Vincent formerly supported the <i>All the same</i> choice, but now supports <i>All the same at run time</i>.</p></div></div></div>
