              <p>I wrestled with these a lot, but couldn't find anything satisfying.  If you treat a custom port as an object on which you can get/set procedures to do the work, you wind up with a getter/setter for every I/O procedure you have.  And you need to say what happens if the user provides only some of them.  It's a big mess.  You can make the procedures generic and use a symbol to indicate which property is being get/set, but all that does is clean up the page some, the implementation is still messy.  Having multiple kinds of ports (binary/textual, string/file, input/output) just makes the mess worse.</p>
              <p>I am opposed to standardization here, and I think the R6RS effort was premature.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>I am pretty conflicted over this issue as well, as Oleg Kiselyov &amp; I (and a few others) tried to work up an I/O SRFI many moons ago. Things got very complex, very quickly.</p>
              <p>Arguably, all I/O should be moved out of the core language specification. C managed to get along with only &quot;library&quot; compliance in I/O for many long years. Additionally, I/O is the canonical example of where side-effects are unavoidable. Nevertheless, Scheme without a free system for reading s-expressions wouldn't feel like much of a lisp either, and the utility of the language would be significantly degraded.</p>
              <p>The I/O library needs significant work, and I am more than half inclined to say it should be a WG2 job, except for the Lisp-y-ness issue.</p></div></div></div>
