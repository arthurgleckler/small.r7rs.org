  I think language specification should not look back that much even though R6RS seemed too progressive. I hope WG2 will decide dropped off stuff again.

    <pre>And of course the large language will be adding back a great many R6RS procedures, especially from the library report, though not necessarily in exactly the same way.</pre>

    <pre>The R7RS-small language is not meant to replace R6RS.  Rather, it is meant to replace R5RS (which R6RS did not do, and perhaps was not meant to do), and at the same time provide a sound basis for the R7RS-large language, which ''is'' meant to replace R6RS.

To complain in the same breath that the draft is a step backwards from R6RS and that it is internally incoherent is itself incoherent.  Without a specification of what features are missing, or provided though not useful, it's impossible to take this complaint as a program for action.</pre>
