              <p>R6RS in turn was gratuitously incompatible with SRFI 23, another extremely common SRFI (it is almost always presumed by reference implementations of other SRFIs, even those that predated it).  The choice was R6RS, SRFI 23, or both (under different names), and any of these choices would have been justifiable.  The WG went with SRFI 23.</p></div></div></div>
