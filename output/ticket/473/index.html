      <div class="description">
        <p>R6RS allows only a single library declaration, <span class="monospace">import</span>,
at the beginning of a program body, and this must
contain all imported libraries.</p>
        <p>Pending the result of ticket <a href="/ticket/472">#472</a> we may also allow
<span class="monospace">include(-ci)</span> and <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> to expand into
imports, and so the single form restriction would not
make sense.  However, it would be reasonable to
restrict all library declarations to the beginning of
a program - the first non-declaration would begin
the real body.  This is the <span class="monospace">beginning-only</span> option.</p>
        <p>The advantage of the <span class="monospace">r6rs</span> proposal is that it would
not require any changes in existing R6RS program
loading implementations to support.  If the result of
ticket <a href="/ticket/472">#472</a> indicates multiple declaration types are
available this option would automatically become
invalid, so you don't need to vote against it on those
grounds.</p>
        <p>The advantage of the <span class="monospace">beginning-only</span> option is
that it becomes possible to statically determine
all program imports without expansion, which was
the primary motivation of a static library system.</p>
        <p>The final alternative is <span class="monospace">any-top-level</span>, which
allows these forms anywhere at the top-level,
possibly interspersed with definitions.  The advantage
of this is that you can cut&amp;paste repl sessions
(for which interspersed imports are always allowed)
as a program.  The disadvantage is that programs
can no longer be resolved separately from expansion.</p></div>

              <p>WG1 voted to adopt the <span class="monospace">beginning-only</span> alternative.  This means that programs (but not libraries or the REPL) must have all their <span class="monospace">import</span> declarations appear at the beginning of the program.</p></div></div></div>
