        <p>R7RS requires an error to be signalled (which means an exception is raised as if by <span class="monospace">raise</span>) in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ol class="number">
          <li>Trying to open for input or delete a file that does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible.</li>
          <li>Specifying an argument to <span class="monospace">scheme-report-environment</span> that the implementation doesn't support.  (It must support 7 and may support other values.)</li>
          <li>An EOF is encountered while <span class="monospace">read</span> is in the middle of a datum.</li>
          <li>Using <span class="monospace">expt</span> to raise zero to the power of a non-real number (alternatively an arbitrary number may be returned).</li></ol>
        <p>This proposal is to provide four standard predicates that identify these specific conditions, to be used in <span class="monospace">guard</span> clauses or in <span class="monospace">with-exception</span> handlers as a portable means of detecting these errors.  Although these predicates may return <span class="monospace">#t</span> on other objects, if one reports <span class="monospace">#t</span> on an object, the others must report <span class="monospace">#f</span>.  Proposed names are <span class="monospace">file-error?</span>, <span class="monospace">scheme-report-error?</span>, <span class="monospace">read-error?</span>, and <span class="monospace">expt-error?</span> respectively.</p></div>
