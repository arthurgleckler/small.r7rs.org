              <p>Yes, It must keep track of fields name. Some kind of reflection is needed for that to work.</p>
              <p>By the way, would it be better if fields are restricted to be symbols only ?</p></div></div></div>

              <p>If we have to do lookups, I'm a little concerned. Lookups can be elided when dealing with a sufficiently smart compiler in many/most cases, but not all, and with interpreters that don't do such optimizations, you will end up having much slower access. Especially when dealing with parents that could come from other libraries, the speed issues become more obvious since it is very hard to do that sort of reasoning in general.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>It's worth noting that delegation techniques are strictly more expressive than inheritance based ones and they completely avoid the hair of multiple inheritance (this was shown in an OOPSLA paper somewhere around 1994-1996 but I've forgotten the title). I think it would be lovely to see a programmer-defined aggregate system that supported delegation as the core mechanism rather than any form of inheritance.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>The reference to inheritance was the OP's. The difference could be trivial; the issue is what types does a new value become a member of (and expose the interfaces of). I do realize that the proposal we are commenting on contains no such information, and I wonder how OP got to inheritance in the first place. The lack of anything resembling a type algebra, even as simple a one as SI, has often been mentioned as one of SRFI-9's main drawbacks, so I expect that it *will* come up somewhere along the line. In fact it is one of the few areas where I'd be willing to see more complexity come into Thing1.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>To illustrate the idea, here is what I am personnaly using in association with let-record for record definition with types:</p><span class="monospace">(record-constructor &lt;Constructor name&gt;
		    &lt;Type checker name&gt;
		    &lt;Fields name&gt;
		    (&lt;Type&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;getter&gt;) ...)
</span>
              <p>Where I view type mainly as predicates. I don't have setters, but I
see no problem in adding it. Here are some examples:</p><span class="monospace">;; A flat record
(record-constructor make-job
		    job-type?
		    job-fields
		    (real?   release  job-release)
		    (real?   duration  job-duration)
		    (string? username  job-username))

(define (List-of type?)
  (lambda (data)
    (and (list? data)
         (let loop ((tmp data))
	    (or (null? tmp)
	        (and (type? (car tmp))
	             (loop (cdr tmp))))))))

;; A record with recursive type field
(record-constructor Tree-of-integer
		    Tree-of-integer-type?
		    Tree-of-integer-fields
		    (integer? element Tree-of-integer-&gt;element)
		    ((List-of Tree-of-integer-type?) subtrees Tree-of-integer-&gt;subtrees))

(Tree-of-integer 17 (list (Tree-of-integer 12 '())))
</span>
              <p>But I could also do type parameterization like this:</p><span class="monospace">(record-constructor (&lt;Constructor name&gt; &lt;Type parameter&gt; ...)
		    &lt;Type checker name&gt;
		    &lt;Fields name&gt;
		    (&lt;Type&gt; &lt;data&gt; &lt;getter&gt;) ...)
</span>
              <p>For instance:</p><span class="monospace">(record-constructor (Tree type?)
		    Tree-type?
		    Tree-fields
		    (type? element Tree-&gt;get-element)
		    ((List-of (Tree type?)) subtrees Tree-&gt;get-subtrees))

</span>
              <p>And then generate records like this:</p><span class="monospace">(define make-integer-tree (Tree integer?))
(make-integer-tree 17 (list (make-integer-tree 12 '())))

(define make-string-tree (Tree string?))
(make-string-tree &quot;foo&quot; (list (make-string-tree &quot;bar&quot; '())))
</span>
              <p>Then let-record easily allows access to fields and I could reuse the same code for records sharing some fields.</p></div></div></div>
