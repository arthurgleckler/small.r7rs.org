        <p>Aaron Hsu writes:</p>
        <p>The standard has, as a whole, favored the introduction of new procedure names to handle new options for procedures that do effectively the same thing. In some cases this makes a bit of sense, as it would be unwieldy to do otherwise. However, there are other places where this does not make sense, and in particular, places where parameters, which we provide, could more readily be used. These places include procedures that provide behavior which is inherently dangerous and ought not to receive a full procedure name. The <span class="monospace">write</span> procedures come to mind. The <span class="monospace">include</span> and <span class="monospace">include-ci</span> forms also come to mind. Adding more names doesn’t scale well, and I think we’ve gone wrong here.</p></div>

              <p>Au contraire.  If that were done, the only way to call <span class="monospace">write</span> with predictable results would be by always wrapping it in a <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> form, which is longer, less clear, and more error-prone (what happens when you set the parameter to a meaningless value?)  The reference to <span class="monospace">include</span> and <span class="monospace">include-ci</span> is misconceived: syntax forms are not affected by the state of (run-time) parameter objects, and without low-level macros there are no such objects at compile time.</p></div></div></div>
