      <div class="description">
        <p>In the current draft, the procedures that open or refer to files use <i>filespecs</i>, which are either strings in R5RS style or else property lists.  The latter are more fundamental: the string filespec <span class="monospace">&quot;foo&quot;</span> is equivalent to the p-list filespec <span class="monospace">(path &quot;foo&quot;)</span>.  Property lists allow various options to be specified in addition to the file path.</p>
        <p>There are only two uses of p-list filespecs in the current draft: the <span class="monospace">buffering</span> key, which allows the user to specify whether ports are buffered or unbuffered, and the possibility of an implementation-dependent extension for supporting file paths which are not Scheme strings.  (In Posix, a path is really a sequence of 8-bit integers with some restrictions on their values, and in Windows, it's a sequence of 16-bit integers with more restrictions on their values.)</p>
        <p>However, it is unclear that either of these is of sufficient importance to support in WG1.  Most of the time, buffering is the Right Thing, and when output buffering causes a problem, the <span class="monospace">flush-output-port</span> procedure can be used to force output to occur.  The overwhelming majority of file paths in existence map directly to strings.</p>
        <p>This ticket proposes, therefore, that only string filespecs be defined in WG1 Scheme, as in R5RS, and that p-list filespecs be deferred to WG2.</p></div>
