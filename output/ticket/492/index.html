        <p>The R7RS proposal doesn't include assertions.  This creates a needless divergence from R6RS, where the <span class="monospace">assert</span> syntax is required in the base.  One could argue that assertions are an unsuitably blunt instrument for error detection and reporting.  Even so, they are useful enough as a teaching tool that I'd like the language to support them.</p></div>

              <p>The WG felt that simple <span class="monospace">assert</span> is insufficient, and a more complex and useful assertion facility was beyond the scope of the small language.  In addition, it is trivial to supply a simple R6RS-compatible <span class="monospace">assert</span> portably, though non-portable versions may be able to provide better reporting.</p></div></div></div>

              <p><span class="monospace">Assert</span> may yet return; the WG is considering the possibility of an accidental change to a member's ballot that caused ticket <a href="/ticket/287">#287</a> on the <a href="/wiki/WG1Ballot5Results">fifth ballot</a> to fail.</p></div></div></div>
