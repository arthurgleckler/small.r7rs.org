        <p>Michael Montague writes:</p>
        <p>I believe that a library should have at most one <span class="monospace">begin</span> and it should have the semantics of a body (though no expressions are required). This would make the semantics of library bodies clear and make R7RS libraries much closer to R6RS libraries, with little loss in expressiveness.</p>
        <p>The question is, what gain is to counterbalance that loss?  It's easy for users who agree with this to make sure their libraries have at most one <span class="monospace">begin</span>, and likewise to reformat existing libraries if they feel strongly about it.  The benefit, then, must be to implementers -- but what benefit is that?  The <span class="monospace">define-library</span> form must be read as a whole, and the first step will normally be to concatenate the <span class="monospace">begin</span> declarations.</p>
        <p>In addition, the restriction in the draft that imported identifiers cannot appear in a library textually before the <span class="monospace">import</span> declaration that introduces them (see <a href="/ticket/353">#353</a>) means that it's possible to construct a library incrementally, adding new <span class="monospace">import</span> and <span class="monospace">begin</span> declarations as you go.  This is a convenience for programs that create libraries.</p>
        <p>Without a definite improvement visible from the restriction to a single <span class="monospace">begin</span> declaration, this proposal would indeed be one of those &quot;weaknesses and restrictions&quot; that the Scheme standards denounce.</p></div>
