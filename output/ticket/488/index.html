        <p>I see the sharp disregard this standard shows for compatibility with R6RS Scheme as a move away from unity in how Scheme implementations add the parts of a modern programming language which R5RS lacked, and I see the sharp disregard this standard shows for the effort so many have put into standardizing, implementing, and extending R6RS as a blow to the united focus of the Scheme community.</p></div>

              <p>I can only say that in my view no such unity, or united focus, exists.  I think I have examined more Schemes more carefully than anyone else in the world, almost fifty of them, and what is immediately apparent is the wild <i>diversity</i> not only in extensions to R5RS, but in the kinds of deviations from it.  This is by no means gratuitous diversity, either; almost every Scheme has its own set of goals, explicit or tacit, that distinguishes it from all others.  Doubtless R6RS was <i>intended</i> to provide that united focus, but it has clearly not done so.  It is not even the case that every implementation that provides it recommends its routine use.</p></div></div></div>

              <p>I will add that the introduction of R6RS was not in itself a move toward or away from unity, but the fact that it was not widely accepted by existing implementations caused a de facto separation of implementations into R5RS and R6RS.  As has been noted, R7RS-small is not directly intended to address this separation.</p></div></div></div>
