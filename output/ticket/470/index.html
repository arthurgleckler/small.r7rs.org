I think everyone assumes this means doing what R6RS does.  The wording there is &quot;The `equal?` predicate returns `#t` if and only if the (possibly infinite) unfoldings of its arguments into regular trees are equal as ordered trees.&quot;

This doesn't strike me as very clear, but we'll need to use if we can't find anything better.</span><span class="new-value">Currently we say that `equal?` must detect loops, but we don't say what it should do.
