        <p>Denis Washington made the following <a href="http://lists.scheme-reports.org/pipermail/scheme-reports/2011-July/001170.html">proposal</a> for the names of the variants of Scheme defined by WG1 and WG2:</p>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I know it is a bit early to discuss this, but as I saw that this was
mentioned again recently in the scheme-reports mailing list (in the
context of module naming), I quickly wanted to write up a proposal of
how the WG1 and WG2 standards could be named in the future.</p>
        <p>First of all, I think that it is expected by many that what will end up
being WG1 Scheme should labeled the actual &quot;Scheme&quot; programming language</p>
        <ul>
          <li>not &quot;Small Scheme&quot; or something - as this is what is thought as being</li></ul>
        <p>Scheme: a language that is minimal but practical. Also, WG1 is the only
document that has mandatory language features, so it natural to still
name every implementation that implements these features as a complete
Scheme implementation.</p>
        <p>Following this line of thought, WG2's all-optional modules and rules can
be thought of as &quot;extensions&quot; to the core language, but extensions that
are agreed up on (as opposed to implementation-specific).</p>
        <p>So in summary, I'd like to propose the following names for the WG1
documents:</p>
        <p>WG1: *Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme, Revised 2011* (abbr.: RS11)</p>
        <p>WG2: *Report on Standard Extensions to the Algorithmic Language Scheme,
Revised 2011* (abbr.: RSES11; alternatively, &quot;[...] Commobn Extensions
[...]&quot;, abbr. RCES11; should probably be &quot;Published 2011&quot; as there is no
original document to revise.)</p>
        <p>The standard module namespace could then be moved from (scheme ...) to,</p>
        <ol class="alpha-lower" start="5">
          <li>g., (rsn ...) (analogous to (rnrs ...) from R6RS).</li></ol>
        <p>I hope this proposal is helpful.</p>
        <p>Regards,
Denis Washington</p></div>
