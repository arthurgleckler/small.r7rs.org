        <p>No Scheme standard prescribes how complex numbers interoperate with exactness.  Different implementations provide inexact complex numbers only, exact and inexact complex numbers, and mixed-exactness complex numbers (see <a href="/wiki/ComplexRepresentations">ComplexRepresentations</a> for who provides what).</p>
        <p>Mixed-exactness complex numbers, however, are problematic.  As a whole they must be treated as inexact, and R7RS-draft already says so.  However, in implementations where 1.0+2i, 1+2.0i, and 1.0+2.0i are distinct in the sense of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>, they are all = and have the same exactness.  This means that their behavior is different under arithmetic operations that treat the real and imaginary parts separately, which seems counter-intuitive.  The Common Lisp Hyperspec does not permit mixed-exactness complex numbers; CLISP provides them as an extension.</p>
        <p>The five implementations in the test suite that provide mixed-exactness complex numbers are MIT, Gambit, Chibi, Mosh, STklos.</p></div>
