      <h2 id="RandomnessinthestyleofCommonLisp">Randomness in the style of Common Lisp</h2>
      <p>This proposal for random numbers is not a literal transcription of the Common Lisp interface, but it uses the same concepts, and the text is a heavily edited version of the CLHS.  I have added <span class="monospace">make-strong-random-source</span> to what is in CL.</p>
      <p>A <i>random-source object</i> is an encapsulation of the state information used by a pseudo-random number generator.  Its state, which is implementation-dependent, can be printed out and successfully read back in by the same implementation, but might not function correctly as a random-source state in another implementation.  Random-source objects are a disjoint type.</p>
      <h2 id="Procedures">Procedures</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-random-source)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a random-source object that has been randomly initialized by some implementation-defined means.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-strong-random-source)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a random-source object whose state has been randomly initialized by some implementation-defined means.  This may be the same as <span class="monospace">make-random-source</span>, but should if possible use a truly random source of bits (such as <span class="monospace">/dev/random</span> on certain systems) to initialize its state.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-random-source-from-state </span><i>state</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a random-source object whose state is a copy of <i>state</i>, so that mutating <i>state</i> does not affect the random-source object.  It is an error to pass a mutated <i>state</i> object.  The result will generate the same sequence of random numbers that the original random-source object would have generated as of the time <span class="monospace">random-source-state</span> was invoked on it.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(random-source-state </span><i>random-source</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns an implementation-specific object representing a copy of the state encapsulated by <i>random-source</i>.  This object must be printable and rereadable.  It must also be suitable for passing to <span class="monospace">make-random-source-from-state</span>.  Providing this mechanism makes it possible to save and reconstitute a random-source in a file or database, or to pass it across a network to an equivalent implementation.  Mutating the result of this procedure does not affect <i>random-source</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(copy-random-source </span><i>random-source</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a random-source object whose state is an independent copy of the state of <i>random-source</i>.  Calling this procedure is equivalent to <span class="monospace">(make-random-source-from-state (random-source-state </span><i>random-source</i><span class="monospace">)</span>, but potentially more efficient because it can avoid copying the state twice.  The result and <i>random-source</i> will henceforth return the same sequence of values, allowing the same series of pseudo-random numbers to be generated many times within a single program.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(current-random-source </span>[<i>random-source</i>]<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>A parameter that returns or sets the default random-source object.  Its initial value must be a random-source object, but is implementation-dependent.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(random </span><i>limit</i> [<i>random-source</i>]<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a pseudo-random number that is a non-negative number less than <i>limit</i>.  <i>Limit</i> must be an exact integer (in which case <span class="monospace">random</span> returns an exact integer), or an inexact real number (in which case <span class="monospace">random</span> returns an inexact real number).</p>
      <p>If the <i>random-source</i>, which is modified by this function, encapsulates the internal state maintained by the random number generator.  If not specified, the value of <span class="monospace">(current-random-source)</span> is used.</p>
      <p>An approximately uniform choice distribution is used. If <i>limit</i> is an integer, each of the possible results occurs with (approximate) probability 1/<i>limit</i>.</p>
      <h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2><span class="monospace"> (&lt;= 0 (random 1000) 1000) =&gt;  true

       (state2 (copy-random-source (current-random-source))))
   (= (random 1000 state1) (random 1000 state2))) =&gt;  true
