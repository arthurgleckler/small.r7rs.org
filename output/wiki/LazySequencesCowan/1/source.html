    <pre>== Lazy sequences ==

Preliminary list of procedures for lazy sequences.  Lazy sequences are based on GeneratorsGauche, so there are only a few constructors.

== Implementation notes ==

An lseq is a QueuesCowan queue plus a generator.  Queues can be shared between lseqs, which means that you are not allowed to remove anything from them, and the only addition operation is `lseq-realize-once!`, which realizes one value and adds it to the back of the queue.</pre>
