      <p>I've been poking around the usual list of Schemes, trying to find out
what the behavior is when an identifier is defined as a value and then
redefined as syntax.  For example:</p><span class="monospace">        (define (noodle) (foodle))
        (define (foodle) 23)
        (noodle) =&gt; ??
        
        (define-syntax foodle (syntax-rules ()
          ((foodle) 17)))
        (noodle) =&gt; ??
        
        (define (noodle) (foodle))
        (noodle) =&gt; ??
</span>
      <p>I tested Racket, Gauche, MIT, Chicken, Bigloo, Scheme48/scsh, Guile 2.0,
Kawa, SISC, Chibi, Chez, SCM, IronScheme, Ikarus, Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh,
STklos, and Scheme 9.</p>
      <p>All the implementations behave the same way on the first and third calls
to <span class="monospace">noodle</span>, returning 23 and 17 respectively.  The first definition of
<span class="monospace">noodle</span> refers to <span class="monospace">foodle</span>, which is undefined, and is therefore assumed to
be a variable.  (Some but not all Schemes print a warning at this point.)</p>
      <p>The second definition of <span class="monospace">noodle</span> refers to the current (syntax) definition
of <span class="monospace">foodle</span>.  All but Guile and Chibi also return 23 on the second call to
noodle, ignoring the syntax definition.  Guile and Chibi, however, signal
an error to the effect that a macro was invoked where a function was expected.</p></div></body></html>
