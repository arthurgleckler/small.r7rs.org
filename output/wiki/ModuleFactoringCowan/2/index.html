      <p>Here's my counterproposal to <a href="/wiki/ModuleFactoringShinn">ModuleFactoringShinn</a>, with rationales:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Move <span class="monospace">(scheme io)</span> back to the base.
          <ul>
            <li>It provides string-ports and the shared function of all ports, and there is no reason why all Schemes shouldn't provide these.  Note that <span class="monospace">(scheme io)</span> was never actually proposed or voted on, and its presence in the first draft is an error by the editors.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Don't provide an umbrella module for I/O.
          <ul>
            <li>Files, reading Scheme objects, and writing Scheme objects are orthogonal.  Demanding that your implementation provide all of them as a matter of course, across the whole range of Schemes, doesn't make much sense.  We already have a ticket allowing Schemes to pre-import whichever modules they want in the REPL.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Leave <span class="monospace">interaction-environment</span> in the <span class="monospace">(scheme repl)</span> module.
          <ul>
            <li>Alex wants to move this to <span class="monospace">(scheme eval)</span>, but the essence of <span class="monospace">(scheme repl)</span> is that it provides not only evaluation of expressions, but a mutable global environment.  There is no reason why a Scheme can't provide the first without the second.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Leave <span class="monospace">case-lambda</span> in the base module.
          <ul>
            <li>It captures a useful pattern and can be optimized by a slick compiler or by hand.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Move <span class="monospace">(scheme multiple-values)</span> back to the base.
          <ul>
            <li>Multiple values are easy to hack an implementation for (lists, or a list wrapped in a record if you insist), and at least <span class="monospace">exact-integer-sqrt</span> depends on them.  Alex wants to move this procedure to a separate module so it can depend on <span class="monospace">(scheme multiple-values)</span>, but I think that's <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pelion">piling Pelion on Ossa</a>.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Rename <span class="monospace">(scheme unicode)</span> to <span class="monospace">(scheme char)</span>.
          <ul>
            <li>Alex and I agree on this one.  The essence of this module is that it does things which, on a full-Unicode system, require a big table.  Making it a module means that you can have full Unicode without the big table unless specific code requires it.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Move <span class="monospace">char-alphabetic?</span>, <span class="monospace">char-numeric?</span>, <span class="monospace">char-upper-case?</span>, <span class="monospace">char-lower-case?</span> and <span class="monospace">char-whitespace?</span> to <span class="monospace">(scheme char)</span>.
          <ul>
            <li>Alex and I agree on this one; not doing it in the first place was an oversight on my part.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Move the normalization procedures to <span class="monospace">(scheme char normalization)</span>.
          <ul>
            <li>I still prefer to keep the names of WG1 modules simple, but okay, fine.</li></ul></li></ul>
      <h2 id="Notpartoftheproposal">Not part of the proposal</h2>
      <p>Alex says that depending on discussion, he would consider moving
the following out of the core:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">syntax-rules</span></li>
        <li><span class="monospace">define-record-type</span></li>
        <li>blob procedures</li>
        <li><span class="monospace">string-ref</span> and <span class="monospace">string-set!</span> (but possibly he means <span class="monospace">string-set!</span> and <span class="monospace">string-fill</span>?)</li></ul>
      <p>The first three are IMO important parts of Scheme and cheap to provide directly on all reasonable systems.  There is no reason why all Schemes can't support them, which I consider the most important factor in moving things to modules.  It doesn't make sense for all Schemes to provide inexact arithmetic (which is mostly about having floating-point instructions available) or files, so they belong in modules.</p>
      <p>I am no fan of mutable strings, but reluctantly I conclude that programs depend on them and we can't get rid of them, so all Schemes might as well provide them.  Hence no module.</p></div></body></html>
