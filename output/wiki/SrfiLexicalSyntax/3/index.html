      <p>This is a list of the SRFIs in final state that extend the R5RS lexical syntax.</p>
      <p>SRFI 4 provides lexical syntax for homogeneous numerical vectors of the form <span class="monospace">#u8 list</span>, <span class="monospace">#s8 list</span>, <span class="monospace">#f32 list</span>, etc..  PLT, Gauche, Gambit, Chicken, Bigloo, Guile, Kawa, Scheme48, STklos, RScheme provide this SRFI.  A close variant of this syntax, <span class="monospace">#vu8</span> for unsigned byte vectors is provided in R6RS, which means that IronScheme, Ikarus, Larceny/R6RS, Ypsilon, and Mosh also support it.</p>
      <p>SRFI 10 provides <span class="monospace">#,(tag datum ...)</span>, which causes a procedure bound to <span class="monospace">keyword</span> to be applied to <span class="monospace">args</span> at read time.  This is similar to, but not the same as, CL <span class="monospace">#,</span> syntax.  Gauche, Chicken, Guile, SISC, STklos, RScheme support this SRFI.</p>
      <p>SRFI 30 provides <span class="monospace">#|...|#</span> nested comments.  PLT, Gauche, MIT, Chicken, scsh, Kawa, SISC, Larceny/R5RS, STklos, RScheme, S7 support this SRFI.  It is also part of R6RS, which means that IronScheme, Ikarus, Larceny/R6RS, Ypsilon, and Mosh also support it.</p>
      <p>SRFI 49 provides indentation-sensitive syntax.  There is no known support for this anywhere except in the SRFI itself, which is written in Guile.</p>
      <p>SRFI 58 provides CL-compatible <span class="monospace">#nA datum</span> for multi-dimensional general arrays.  This SRFI is supported only in SCM, though Chicken provides a non-SRFI egg that supports the same syntax.</p>
      <p>SRFI 62 provides <span class="monospace">#;</span> to comment out a single datum.  PLT, Gauche, MIT, Chicken, Kawa, SISC, Chibi, Larceny/R5RS, and Chibi support it.  It is also part of R6RS, which means that IronScheme, Ikarus, Larceny/R6RS, Ypsilon, and Mosh also support it.</p>
      <p>SRFI 88 provides self-evaluating keywords, similar to those in CL but with trailing colons.  This is DSSSL-compatible.  Chicken, Guile, Kawa, STklos, S7 support this SRFI.</p>
      <h3 id="JohnCowan'sopinions">John Cowan's opinions</h3>
      <p>Provide both kinds of comments.</p>
      <p>Leave holes in the lexical syntax for homogeneous vectors and general arrays (say that #a and #v are reserved).</p>
      <p>Do not provide SRFI 10, because of the phasing problem.  Binding the tag to its procedure happens at run time, which is too late to affect load time.</p>
      <p>Consider keywords.  They're very nice.</p>
      <p>Ignore SRFI 49.</p></div></body></html>
