My first exposure to Scheme (apart from education) was when I worked as a C++ developper. I was forced to make templates for expressing &quot;functions as values&quot; ideas I often had, that was not satisfying for me, as that language seemed to discourage me from doing that. I was striked by the beauty of how Lisp solved the same problem. Until that time I decided to know more about this language. Lexical scoping, absence of &quot;funcall&quot; (how odd this is, isn't it ?) and minimal design leads me to Scheme.

As Eric Raymond said in his &quot;How to become a hacker essay&quot;: &quot;LISP is worth  learning  for a different reason â€” the profound  enlightenment  experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot.&quot; That's so true that I really recommend people learning Scheme.

Now I use it daily for 10 years and I am always glad with it. I am very grateful to participate in the Scheme Working Groups and wish the new coming R7RS to be even better for real-world applications.
