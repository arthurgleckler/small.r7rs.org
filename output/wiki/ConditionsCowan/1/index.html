      <h2 id="Conditions">Conditions</h2>
      <p>This is a WG2 proposal for condition objects.  A condition object encapsulates information about an
exceptional situation.  Typically the rest of the system is notified about a condition using the <span class="monospace">raise</span> and <span class="monospace">raise-continuable</span> predicates and their relatives.  Conditions are logically independent of the exception system, however:  conditions may be used for any purpose, and any object may be passed to the exception system.</p>
      <p>The design of this condition system attempts to assume as little as possible about any existing implementation-specific condition system.  In particular, there is no specified relationship between conditions and records, as there is in R6RS, nor is there any notion of subtyping required by the system.  There are condition types for convenience in dispatching, but they are just symbols and in general entail nothing about what information is encapsulated, as different implementations will provide different kinds of information when creating an implementation-specified condition.</p>
      <p>Within the above constraints, I have attempted to make the names as compatible as possible with <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-8.html#node_sec_7.2">the R6RS condition system</a> and its predecessors <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/srfi-35.html">SRFI 35</a> and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-36/srfi-36.html">SRFI 36</a>, and with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-12/srfi-12.html">SRFI 12</a>.</p>
      <p>A condition is said to be &quot;belong to type <i>sym</i>&quot; if (a) it was created by a call to <span class="monospace">make-condition</span> that was passed the symbol <span class="monospace">sym</span> as one of its condition types, or (b) it belongs to an implementation-defined set (possibly empty) of conditions of type <i>sym</i>.  This allows implementation-dependent condition objects to participate in this condition system.</p>
      <h2 id="Constructor">Constructor</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-condition </span><i>symlist</i> ( <i>sym</i> <i>obj</i> ) ...<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated condition which belongs to the types whose names are given in <span class="monospace">symlist</span>.  The remainder of the arguments are alternating property names (which are symbols) and values (which can be any object) that specify the information encapsulated by this condition.  It is an error if the value associated with the property name <span class="monospace">message</span> is not a string; it is also an error if the value associated with the property name <span class="monospace">irritants</span> is not a list.</p>
      <h2 id="Predicates">Predicates</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition of any type, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition-of-type? </span><i>obj</i> <i>sym</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <i>sym</i>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <h2 id="Accessors">Accessors</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition-types </span><i>condition</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the list of types to which <i>condition</i> belongs.  It is an error to attempt to mutate this list.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition-properties </span><i>condition</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the list of property names associated with this condition.  It is an error to attempt to mutate this list.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition-ref </span><i>condition sym</i> [ <i>default</i> ] <span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the property value associated with the property named <i>sym</i> of <i>condition</i>.  If there is no such property, returns <i>default</i>.  If <i>default</i> is not specified, returns <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="Meta">Meta</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition-predicate </span><i>sym</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a predicate which will return <span class="monospace">#t</span> if applied to a condition belonging to type <i>sym</i>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(condition-accessor</span><i>sym</i> [ <i>default</i> ] <span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns an accessor which will return the value of <i>sym</i> if applied to a condition object and <i>default</i> otherwise.  If <i>default</i> is not specified, the accessor will return <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="Specificpredicates">Specific predicates</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(error-object? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">simple</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions are normally created only by user code.  <i>Part of the small language, but shown here for completeness.</i></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(file-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">file</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if there is an error related to file operations; in particular, the inability to open a file for input.  <i>Part of the small language, but shown here for completeness.</i></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(read-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">read</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if there is an error related to <span class="monospace">read</span>, such as a lexical syntax error in the input.  <i>Part of the small language, but shown here for completeness.</i></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(syntax-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">syntax</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if program code is syntactically ill-formed.  When such a condition is raised, it may or may not be possible for the exception system to catch it.  <i>Part of the small language, but shown here for completeness.</i></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(domain-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">domain</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if a procedure is passed an argument that is not in its domain, either because it is of the wrong type or because it has an unacceptable value, as well as in analogous situations.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(mismatch-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">mismatch</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.

      <p><span class="monospace">(undefined-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">undefined</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if an attempt is made to get the value of a variable that has not been defined, as well as in analogous situations.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(non-continuable-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition of type <span class="monospace">non-continuable</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if an attempt is made to continue from an exception raised by <span class="monospace">raise</span>, as well as in analogous situations.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(input-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">input</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.

      <p><span class="monospace">(output-error? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition belonging to type <span class="monospace">output</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.

      <p><span class="monospace">(implementation-restriction? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a condition of type <span class="monospace">implementation-restriction</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.  Such conditions may be created by the implementation if an implementation restriction occurs such as running out of memory or exceeding the maximum representable size of an exact number, as well as in analogous situations.</p>
