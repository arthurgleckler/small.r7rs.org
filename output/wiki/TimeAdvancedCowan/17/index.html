      <h2 id="Dateandtimearithmetic">Date and time arithmetic</h2>
      <p>This is a WG2 proposal for date and time arithmetic, loosely based on Java's <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net">Joda Time</a> functions.  It's possible to implement SRFI 19 on top of it, but it provides much more flexibility.</p>
      <h2 id="Instants">Instants</h2>
      <p>For the purposes of this proposal, an <i>instant</i> is an exact integer representing a particular second of the TAI scale, such that 0 represents midnight on January 1, 1970 TAI (equivalent to ten seconds before midnight Universal Time) and the value 1 represents one TAI second later.  The current instant can be obtained more or less accurately by evaluating <span class="monospace">(round (current-second))</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="Chronologies">Chronologies</h2>
      <p>A <i>chronology</i> is a disjoint and immutable object that describes a particular calendar, such as the ISO, Gregorian, Julian, TAI, Jewish, Islamic, Persian, French Revolutionary, Maya, Chinese, Buddhist, Thai, Coptic, or Ethiopic calendar.  Implementations MUST support the ISO chronology, and MAY support any of the other calendars mentioned here, or indeed any calendar not mentioned here.  (The ISO chronology is similar to the Gregorian chronology, except that in Gregorian there are two eras and no year 0; in ISO there is only one era and the years 0, -1, -2, ... correspond to the Gregorian years 1, 2, 3 ... BC.)</p>
      <p>Chronologies also incorporate the concept of time zone.  An implementation MUST support the UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) time zone and any time zones expressible as a fixed offset in minutes from UTC.  It SHOULD support the historical time zones of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database">tz database</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="Chronologyprocedures">Chronology procedures</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(default-chronology)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the default implementation-dependent chronology, which may include time zone information.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(chronology </span><i>name</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Return a chronology named by the symbol <i>name</i>.  The ISO chronology is named <span class="monospace">iso</span>.  If provided, the Gregorian chronology is named <span class="monospace">gregorian</span>, the Julian chronology is named <span class="monospace">julian</span>, and the TAI calendar is named <span class="monospace">tai</span>.  The names of other chronologies are implementation-dependent.  The chronologies returned by this procedure are in the UTC time zone.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(chronology-names)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a list of the symbols naming the chronologies provided by the implementation.  It is an error to modify this list.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(chronology-name </span><i>chronology</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the symbol that names <i>chronology</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(chronology? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a chronology and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(chronology-with-time-zone </span><i>name</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>chronology</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>timezone</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a chronology object named <i>name</i> based on <i>chronology</i>, but with the time zone specified by <i>timezone</i>.  In the ISO and Gregorian chronologies, if <i>timezone</i> is an integer, it represents the number of minutes ahead of UTC, but if the implementation supports the <span class="monospace">tz</span> database, and <i>timezone</i> is a string containing a time zone name defined by that database, it represents the time zone with that name.  Otherwise, the interpretation of <i>timezone</i> is implementation-dependent.  Chronologies created by this procedure are added to the list returned by future calls to <span class="monospace">chronology-names</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(chronology-time-zone </span><i>chronology</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>When <i>chronology</i> was returned from <span class="monospace">default-chronology</span>, returns an implementation-dependent value.  When <i>chronology</i> was returned from <span class="monospace">chronology</span>, returns 0.  When <i>chronology</i> was returned from <span class="monospace">chronology-with-time-zone</span>, returns the time zone value (of whatever type) which was specified to that procedure.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-compound-chronology </span><i>chronology1</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>chronology2</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>instant</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a chronology that uses <i>chronology2</i> at all times before <i>instant</i>, and <i>chronology1</i> for all times including and following <i>instant</i>.  This is useful for constructing chronologies that transition from Julian to Gregorian at a specified date.</p>
      <h2 id="Dateobjects">Date objects</h2>
      <p>A <i>date object</i> is a member of an immutable disjoint type that specifies information about a date or time with respect to a certain chronology.  For example, with respect to the ISO, Gregorian, or Julian chronologies, a date may represent a specific year, a specific week of a specific year, or an instant in time precise to a second.  On the other hand, a date object may contain just a particular month.  Date objects have multiple numeric-valued fields such as <span class="monospace">year</span> or <span class="monospace">minute-of-day</span>, whose meanings and possible values are determined by the chronology.</p>
      <h2 id="Dateprocedures">Date procedures</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-date </span><i>chronology</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>alist</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a date object using <i>chronology</i>.  <i>Alist</i> is an association list that maps symbols which are field names meaningful to <i>chronology</i> to associated numeric values.  An error is signaled if the field values are invalid or inconsistent.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a date object, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-&gt;alist </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated alist containing the fields of <i>date</i>.  Implementations SHOULD provide computed fields as well as explicitly set ones.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-field </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the numeric value of the field named <i>fieldname</i> (a symbol) within <i>date</i>, or <span class="monospace">#f</span> if there is no such field.  If the specified field was not provided when <i>date</i> was constructed, and it is possible to compute its value from the values of fields that were provided, the value is computed and returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(convert-date </span><i>chronology</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Equivalent to <span class="monospace">(make-date </span><i>chronology</i><span class="monospace"> (date-&gt;alist </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace">))</span>, but potentially much more efficient.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-update </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>value</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a date object based on <i>date</i>, but with the field named <i>fieldname</i> updated to <i>value</i>.  An error is signaled if the field is unknown or the value is out of range.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-increment </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>increment</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a date object which is later than <i>date</i> by <i>increment</i> measured in the units specified by <i>fieldname</i>, or earlier if <i>increment</i> is negative.   Returns <span class="monospace">#f</span> if an appropriate date object cannot be constructed due to lack of information in <i>date</i> An error is signaled if <i>fieldname</i> is unknown.</p>
      <p>For example, <span class="monospace">(date-increment </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> 'day-of-month 7)</span> adds seven days to <i>date</i>
(which is typically the same as one week, but may be different in some chronologies).</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-chronology </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the chronology associated with <i>date</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-field-maximum </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-field-minimum </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the maximum or minimum legal value of the field named <i>fieldname</i> in the chronology associated with <i>date</i>.  This value is not necessarily the same for all instants; for example, 28 is the maximum value of <span class="monospace">day-of-month</span> if <span class="monospace">month</span> has the value 2 (February).  Returns <span class="monospace">#f</span> if the value cannot be determined (there is no maximum or minimum year in the ISO chronology, for example).</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-round </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-ceiling </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-floor </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(date-truncate </span><i>date</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>fieldname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a date object which is the same as <i>date</i>, but adjusted to the nearest integral value of <i>fieldname</i> using the <span class="monospace">round</span>, <span class="monospace">ceiling</span>, <span class="monospace">floor</span>, or <span class="monospace">truncate</span> functions.  This may cause other fields to change their values as well.</p>
      <h2 id="ISOdatefields">ISO date fields</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise noted, the values of these fields MUST be either exact integers or <span class="monospace">#f</span> if they were not explicitly set and cannot be calculated from the given information.  These fields are specified for the ISO, Gregorian, and Julian chronologies, but they may be relevant to other chronologies as well.  For interoperability, every chronology must support the <span class="monospace">instant</span> field.</p>
