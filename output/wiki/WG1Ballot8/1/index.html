      <p>Ballot 8 was conducted informally on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/scheme-reports-wg1/-Z65vUeerPk">a poll thread</a> of the WG1 mailing list.</p>
      <h3 id="#315nullcharactermaynotbeusableinstrings"><a href="/ticket/315">#315</a> null character may not be usable in strings</h3>
      <p>The original proposal was to make <span class="monospace">(string-set! str n #\null)</span> unspecified, which was rejected, at least partly on the ground that R7RS implementations can already forbid specified characters from appearing in strings.  However, the ASCII character set (which includes <span class="monospace">#\null</span>) could not be forbidden, per <a href="/wiki/UnicodeCowan">UnicodeCowan</a>.  Consequently, the rationale given by several voters that there was no need to make a special case for <span class="monospace">#\null</span> was incorrect.  The WG therefore chose from the following options:</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">forbid-nothing</span>: every character supported by the implementation must be allowed to appear in strings.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">forbid-any-but-128</span>: every ASCII character <i>including</i> <span class="monospace">#\null</span> must be allowed in strings.  (This is the default, corresponding to the <span class="monospace">no</span> vote on Ballot 5.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">forbid-any-but-127</span>: every ASCII character <i>excluding</i> <span class="monospace">#\null</span> must be allowed in strings.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">forbid-any-but-97</span>: every printable ASCII character plus <span class="monospace">#\space</span>, <span class="monospace">#\tab</span>, and <span class="monospace">#\newline</span> must be allowed in strings.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">open</span>: any character may be forbidden in strings.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">reader</span>: the characters required by the reader, plus <span class="monospace">[A-Za-z]</span>, must be allowed in strings.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">unspecified</span>: say nothing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> forbid-nothing, forbid-any-but-128, forbid-any-but-127, forbid-any-but-96, open, reader, unspecified, undecided</li>
        <li><b>Default:</b> forbid-any-but-128</li></ul></div></body></html>
