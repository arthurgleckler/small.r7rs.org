      <p>Scheme (before R7RS) and Common Lisp require that implementations understand short-float, single-float, double-float and long-float syntax.  These are written by replacing the <span class="monospace">e</span> of exponential notation with an <span class="monospace">s</span>, <span class="monospace">f</span>, <span class="monospace">d</span>, or <span class="monospace">l</span> respectively.  However, there is no requirement that any of these be distinct, only that they be consistent: short-floats cannot have more precision than long-floats, for example.  Common Lisp requires that <span class="monospace">e</span> notation be equivalent to <span class="monospace">f</span> notation by default; Scheme has no such requirement.</p>
      <p>I asked the usual Schemes and some Common Lisps to evaluate <span class="monospace">3.1415926535897932385s0</span>,  <span class="monospace">3.1415926535897932385f0</span>, <span class="monospace">3.1415926535897932385d0</span>, and <span class="monospace">3.1415926535897932385l0</span>, where the numeric value is a 64-bit version of <i>π</i>.  Common Lisps were asked about precision directly using the standard <span class="monospace">float-bits</span> procedure.  For Scheme, I inferred how many bits of precision were provided by the answers.  Here are the results (note that IEEE doubles are 53-bit precision and IEEE singles are 24-bit precision):</p>
      <p>All four numbers are the same and have 53-bit precision:  Gauche, Gambit, Chicken (with or without the numbers egg)*, Guile*, Kawa, SISC, Chibi, SCM, Chez, Vicare, Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, IronScheme, STklos*, KSI†, S7†, UMB, VX*, SXM*, Spark, Dfsch†, Inlab*, Sagittarius</p>
      <p>All four numbers are the same and have 64-bit precision: Scheme 9*</p>
      <p>All four numbers are the same and have 20-bit precision: Shoe</p>
      <p>The first two numbers have 24-bit precision, the last two have 53-bit precision (IEEE double):  Racket, NexJ, Armed Bear CL, Allegro CL, Clozure CL, CMU CL, Embeddable CL, GNU CL, Steel Bank CL, Scieneer CL</p>
      <p>The numbers have 19-bit, 24-bit, 53-bit, and 53-bit precision respectively: LispWorks</p>
      <p>The numbers have 17-bit, 24-bit, 53-bit, and arbitrary (at least 64-bit) precision respectively: CLISP</p>
      <p>The numbers have 24-bit, 24-bit, 53-bit, and arbitrary precision respectively: Kawa</p>
      <p>No inexact numbers: SigScheme, Dream, Oaklisp, Owl Lisp</p>
      <p>Report syntax errors or treat input as identifiers:  Bigloo, Scheme48/scsh, TinyScheme, Dream, RScheme, BDC, XLisp, Rep, Schemik, Elk, Sizzle, FemtoLisp</p>
      <p>Inputs are treated as as special lexical syntax, not as numbers: Llava</p>
