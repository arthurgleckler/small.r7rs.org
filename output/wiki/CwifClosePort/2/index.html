      <p>I created a file named &quot;three&quot; whose content was &quot;3&quot;, and ran the following code in the test Schemes:</p><span class="monospace">(define port #f)
(call-with-input-file &quot;three&quot;
  (lambda (p)
    (set! port p)
    (+ 'a 'b)))  ; signals an exception
(read port)
</span>
      <p>to see if the final <span class="monospace">(read port)</span> would return 3 (meaning that the port was still open after the exception was raised) or would fail with a new exception, something like &quot;closed port&quot;.</p>
      <p>Printed <span class="monospace">3</span>:  Racket, MIT, Chicken, Scheme48/scsh, Guile, Chibi, SCM, Chez, Vicare, Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, STklos, KSi, SigScheme, TinyScheme, Dream, RScheme, XLisp, Elk, VX, SXM, Spark, Inlab, Scheme 9</p>
      <p>Failed with closed-port exception: Gauche, Bigloo, Kawa, SISC, IronScheme, NexJ, Scheme 7, BDC, Sizzle</p>
      <p>Failed for other reasons (typically because <span class="monospace">call-with-input-file</span> is not supported): Shoe, Rep, Schemik, UMB, Oaklisp, Llava, Femtolisp, Dfsch, Owl Lisp</p></div></body></html>
