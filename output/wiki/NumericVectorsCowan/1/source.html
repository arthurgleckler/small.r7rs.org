    <pre>This is a proposal for a WG2 numeric vector API.  The conceit is that we provide what appear to be a set of specialized numeric-only vectors a la SRFI 4, but there really is only one underlying type, the bytevector.  This makes it easy to see a single byte sequence in a variety of ways, not just as homogeneous vectors.

This design differs from related designs in that everything is a separate procedure with minimal arguments; this makes for a ''lot'' of procedures, but each one can be easily inlined by even a very dumb compiler, providing high efficiency.

== Numeric types ==

A &lt;type&gt; consists of a &lt;principal type&gt; followed by an &lt;endianism&gt;.

The &lt;principal type&gt; values are:

 `u8`::
  unsigned 8-bit integer
 `s8`::
  signed 8-bit integer
 `u16`::
  unsigned 16-bit integer
 `s16`::
  signed 16-bit integer
 `u32`::
  unsigned 32-bit integer
 `s32`::
  signed 32-bit integer
 `u64`::
  unsigned 64-bit integer
 `s64`::
  signed 64-bit integer
 `u128`::
  unsigned 128-bit integer
 `s128`::
  signed 128-bit integer
 `f32`::
  32-bit float
 `f64`::
  64-bit float
 `c64`::
  64-bit complex number (two 32-bit floats, real followed by imaginary)
 `c128`::
  128-bit complex number (two 64-bit floats, real followed by imaginary)

The &lt;endianism&gt; values are:

 (empty)::
  Native representations (system-dependent)
 `le`::
  Little-endian (for float and complex, IEEE format)
 `be`::
  Big-endian (for float and complex, IEEE format)

Endianism is not applicable to the `u8` and `s8` types.


== Constructors ==

`(make-&lt;type&gt;vector `''k''` ` [ ''fill'' ]`)`

Returns a newly allocated bytevector of length ''k * b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes consumed by &lt;type&gt;.  ''Fill'' is converted to a binary value according to &lt;type&gt; and used to fill the bytevector; the default is implementation-defined.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector ` ''v'' ... `)`

Returns a newly allocated bytevector of length ''k * b'', where ''k'' is the number of arguments to the procedure and ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.  It is filled with the binary values resulting from encoding the ''v'' values according to &lt;type&gt;.

== Selectors ==

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-length ` ''bytevector''`)`

Returns the length of ''bytevector'' divided by ''b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;, and rounded toward zero.

`(bytevector-&lt;type&gt;-ref` ''bytevector k''`)`

Returns a Scheme number corresponding to the binary value encoded according to ''type'' beginning at offset ''k'' in ''bytevector''.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as potentially containing more than one type.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-ref` ''bytevector k''`)`

Returns a Scheme number corresponding to the binary value encoded according to ''type'' beginning at offset ''k * b'' in ''bytevector'', where ''b'' is the size of the binary value in bytes.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as a uniformly typed vector.

== Mutators ==

(`bytevector-&lt;type&gt;-set!` ''bytevector k v''`)`

Converts ''v'' to a binary value encoded according to ''type'' and places it into ''bytevector'' beginning at offset ''k''.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as potentially containing more than one type.

(`&lt;type&gt;vector-set!` ''bytevector k v''`)`

Converts ''v'' to a binary value encoded according to ''type'' and places it into ''bytevector'' beginning at offset ''k * b'', where ''b'' is the size of the binary value in bytes.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as a uniformly typed vector.

== Conversions ==

(`vector-&gt;&lt;type&gt;vector `''vector''`)`

Returns a vector with the same elements as ''&lt;type&gt;vector''.

(`&lt;type&gt;vector-&gt;vector `''&lt;type&gt;vector''`)`

Returns a &lt;type&gt;vector with the same elements as ''vector''.  It is an error if an element cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.
