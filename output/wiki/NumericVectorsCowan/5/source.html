    <pre>This is a proposal for a simple numeric vector API.  The conceit is that we provide what appear to be a set of specialized numeric-only vectors, but there really is only one underlying type, the bytevector.  This makes it easy to see a single byte sequence in a variety of ways, not just as a homogeneous vector.

This design subsumes [http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-4/srfi-4.html SRFI 4] with the exception of its type predicates.  It differs from related designs such as SRFI 63, SRFI 66, and R6RS in that each procedure listed below actually represents many procedures, one for each defined representation type.  This makes for a ''lot'' of procedures, but many of them can be easily inlined by even a very dumb compiler, providing high efficiency.  The procedures provided are the numeric-vector analogues of the R7RS-small vector API.

== Representation types ==

A &lt;type&gt; consists of a &lt;principal type&gt; followed by an &lt;endianism&gt;.

The &lt;principal type&gt; values are:

 `u8`::
  unsigned 8-bit integer
 `s8`::
  signed 8-bit integer
 `u16`::
  unsigned 16-bit integer
 `s16`::
  signed 16-bit integer
 `u32`::
  unsigned 32-bit integer
 `s32`::
  signed 32-bit integer
 `u64`::
  unsigned 64-bit integer
 `s64`::
  signed 64-bit integer
 `u128`::
  unsigned 128-bit integer
 `s128`::
  signed 128-bit integer
 `f32`::
  32-bit float
 `f64`::
  64-bit float
 `c64`::
  64-bit complex number (two 32-bit floats, real followed by imaginary)
 `c128`::
  128-bit complex number (two 64-bit floats, real followed by imaginary)

The &lt;endianism&gt; values are:

 (empty)::
  Native representations (system-dependent)
 `le`::
  Little-endian (for float and complex, IEEE format)
 `be`::
  Big-endian (for float and complex, IEEE format)

Endianism is not applicable to the `u8` and `s8` types.  Thus there are 3 * 14 - 4, or 38, representation types altogether.


== Constructors ==

`(make-&lt;type&gt;vector `''k''` ` [ ''fill'' ]`)`

Returns a newly allocated bytevector of length ''k * b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.  ''Fill'' is converted to a binary value according to &lt;type&gt; and used to fill the bytevector; the default is implementation-defined.  An error is signaled if ''fill'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector ` ''v'' ... `)`

Returns a newly allocated bytevector of length ''k * b'', where ''k'' is the number of arguments to the procedure and ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.  It is filled with the binary values resulting from encoding the ''v'' arguments according to &lt;type&gt;.  An error is signaled if an argument cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

== Predicates ==

There are no `&lt;type&gt;vector?` predicates, as `bytevector?` is sufficient.

`(bytevector-empty? ` ''bytevector''`)`

Returns `#t` iff ''bytevector'' has length 0.  This procedure is not specialized for different numeric types.


== Selectors ==

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-ref` ''bytevector k''`)`

Returns a Scheme number corresponding to the binary value encoded according to &lt;type&gt; beginning at offset ''k * b'' in ''bytevector'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as a uniformly typed vector.

`(bytevector-&lt;type&gt;-ref` ''bytevector k''`)`

Returns a Scheme number corresponding to the binary value encoded according to &lt;type&gt; beginning at offset ''k'' in ''bytevector''.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as potentially containing more than one type.

Since `bytevector-u8-ref` is defined in the small language, it is excluded here.

== Mutators ==

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-set!` ''bytevector k v''`)`

Converts ''v'' to a binary value encoded according to &lt;type&gt; and places it into ''bytevector'' beginning at offset ''k * b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as a uniformly typed vector.  An error is signaled if ''v'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

`(bytevector-&lt;type&gt;-set!` ''bytevector k v''`)`

Converts ''v'' to a binary value encoded according to &lt;type&gt; and places it into ''bytevector'' beginning at offset ''k''.  This procedure treats ''bytevector'' as potentially containing more than one type.  An error is signaled if ''v'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

Since `bytevector-u8-set!` is defined in the small language, it is excluded here.

== Conversions ==

`(vector-&gt;&lt;type&gt;vector `''vector'' [''start'' [ ''end'' ] ]`)`

`(list-&gt;&lt;type&gt;vector `''list''`)`

Returns a newly allocated bytevector which, when viewed as a &lt;type&gt;vector, has the same elements as ''vector'' or ''list''.  An error is signaled if an element of ''vector'' or ''list'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

`(vector-&gt;&lt;type&gt;vector! `''bytevector at vector'' [''start'' [ ''end'' ] ]`)`

Writes the elements of ''vector'' from ''start'' to ''end'' into ''bytevector'' starting at ''at''.  An error is signaled if an element of ''vector'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

`(list-&gt;&lt;type&gt;vector! `''list at''`)`

Writes the elements of ''list'' into ''bytevector'' starting at ''at''.  An error is signaled if an element of ''vector'' or ''list'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-&gt;vector `''bytevector'' [ ''start'' [ ''end'' ] ]`)`

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-&gt;list `''bytevector'' [ ''start'' [ ''end'' ] ]`)`

Returns a newly allocated vector or list with the elements of ''bytevector'' from ''start'' to ''end'' when viewed as a &lt;type&gt;vector.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-&gt;vector! `''vector at bytevector'' [''start'' [ ''end'' ] ]`)`

Writes the elements of ''bytevector'' when viewed as a &lt;type&gt;vector from ''start'' to ''end'' into ''vector'' starting at ''at''.

== The whole numeric vector ==

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-length ` ''bytevector''`)`

Returns the length of ''bytevector'' divided by ''b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;, and rounded toward zero.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-copy `[ [ ''start'' ] ''end'' ] `)`

These procedures are equivalent to calling `bytevector-copy` with the ''start'' and ''end'' arguments multiplied by ''b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-copy! `''to at from'' [ [ ''start'' ] ''end'' ] `)`

These procedures are equivalent to calling `bytevector-copy!` with the ''start'', ''end'', and ''at'' arguments multiplied by ''b'', where ''b'' is the number of bytes specified by &lt;type&gt;.

There are no `&lt;type&gt;vector-append` procedures, as `bytevector-append` is sufficient.

`(bytevector-concat` ''list-of-bytevector''`)`

Returns the result of concatenating the bytevectors which are members of ''list-of-bytevectors''.  This procedure is not specialized for different numeric types.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-fill! `''bytevector fill'' [ [ ''start'' ] ''end'' ] `)`

Stores ''fill'' in the elements of ''bytevector'' viewed as a &lt;type&gt;vector from ''start'' to ''end''. An error is signaled if ''fill'' cannot be accurately converted to `&lt;type&gt;`.

== Mapping ==

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-map `''proc bytevector1 bytevector2'' ...`)`

Returns a newly allocated bytevector which, when viewed as a &lt;type&gt;vector, contains the results of applying ''proc'' to the elements of the ''bytevector''s when viewed as &lt;type&gt;vectors.

`(&lt;type&gt;vector-for-each `''proc bytevector1 bytevector2'' ...`)`

Applies ''proc'' to the elements of the ''bytevector''s when viewed as &lt;type&gt;vectors.  Returns an unspecified value.
