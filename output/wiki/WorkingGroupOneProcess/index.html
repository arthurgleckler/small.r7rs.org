      <p>This is a rough outline of the process for
Working Group 1, leading up to the first
public draft milestone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introductions and initial position statements (1 month)</li>
        <li>Fact-Finding and Issue Cataloging (1 month)</li>
        <li>Make Proposals, independently or in groups</li>
        <li>Debate Proposals via email and the wiki</li>
        <li>Update Proposals based on feedback</li>
        <li>Preferential Voting</li>
        <li>Draft the winning proposals and submit for public review</li></ul>
      <p>For voting we will use a preferential voting mechanism,
so that any number of proposals can be made without detracting
from each other or forcing an all-or-nothing situation.
The exact method remains to be decided, but will likely be
either ranked pairs or Schultz.  In addition,
at least a minimum percentage, yet to be decided but likely in the
75-90% range, of voters must prefer the winning option to the R5RS
(no-change) option.</p>
      <p>A detailed example of the voting process can be found
in the <a href="/wiki/SampleVoteYakHandler">Yak Handler</a> proposal.</p>
      <p>The hope is that with this system and a more or less balanced
representation of Scheme implementations and ideals among the
members, we can ensure that while nothing crazy gets added,
any feature that is almost universally desired _will_ get
accepted, even if we can't agree on all the details.</p>
      <p>Overall it's important that Working Group 1 err on the side
of conservatism, to ensure a wider acceptance among implementations
than R6RS received.  It's harder to remove features than to add them,
and we have Working Group 2 to add any extra features necessary.</p></div></body></html>
