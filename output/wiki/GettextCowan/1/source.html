    <pre>== Gettext package ==

Gettext is a package for the localization of strings.  To substitute the translated version of a string for the original, write `(_ &quot;string&quot;)` instead of `&quot;string&quot;`, and the Right Thing should happen -- provided you have installed the appropriate translation object correctly in advance.

== Basic procedures ==

There is really only one `_` procedure, but it is specified as multiple cases here.

`(_ `[''translation''] ''string''`)`

Look up ''string'' in ''translation'' and return the translated version as a string.  If ''translation'' is not specified, use the installed translation.

`(_ `[''translation''] ''string''` `''encoding''`)`

Look up ''string'' in ''translation'' and return the translated version as a blob encoded according to ''encoding''.  If ''encoding'' is `#t`, use the encoding of the translation.  If ''encoding'' is a string, use it as the name of the encoding to be used.  If the system does not know that encoding, signal an error.  If ''translation'' is not specified, use the installed translation.

`(_ `[''translation''] ''singular''` `''plural''` `''n''`)`

If ''n'' equals 1, look up ''singular'' in ''translation'' and return the translated version as a string.  If ''n'' does not equal 1, look up ''singular'' and return the appropriate associated plural translation (some languages need more than one plural translation depending on the value of ''n'').  See `null-translation` for an explanation of the ''plural'' argument.  If ''translation'' is not specified, use the installed translation.

`(_ `[''translation''] ''singular''` `''plural''` `''n''` `''encoding''`)`

The same as the previous case, except that the returned value is a blob.  The contents of the blob are determined by ''encoding'' as explained above.

== Loading and installing translations ==

A translation is an immutable object of a disjoint type.

`(make-translation `''domain''` `[''localedir'' [''languages'' [''fallback? [''encoding'']]]]`)`

Locates and returns a translation for ''domain'' (a string, typically the name of an application or a library).  ''Localedir'' is a directory in which to search for translations; if not specified or `#f`, an implementation-dependent directory is used.  ''Languages'' is a list of strings which are language tags; if not specified or `#f`, an implementation-dependent list is used, usually derived from an environment variable.  ''Encoding'' is used to specify the name of the encoding used by the translation to create blobs; if not specified or `#f`, an implementation-defined encoding is used.  If ''fallback?'' is true and no appropriate translation object can be located, a null translation object is returned; if it is not specified or `#f`, an error is signaled.

`(null-translation)`

Returns a null translation object that translates all strings into themselves.  When a singular/plural translation is requested, the object translates ''singular'' to itself if ''n'' is equal to 1 and translates ''singular'' to ''plural'' otherwise.  This is the only case in which the ''plural'' argument to `_` is used.

The domain of a null translation object is `&quot;&quot;`.  The encoding used by the null translation object to create blobs is system-defined.

`(translation? `''obj''`)`

Returns `#t` if ''obj'' is a translation object, and `#f` otherwise.

`(translation-domain `''translation''`)`

Returns the domain of the translation as a string.  It is an error to modify this string.

`(translation-properties `''translation''`)`

Returns an a-list containing the properties of the translation; these are implementation-dependent, and the list may be empty.

`(translation-encoding `''translation''`)`

Returns the string name of the native encoding of the translation.

`(translation-output-encoding `''translation''`)`

Returns the string name of the encoding that was specified to `make-translation`.

`(install-translation! `''translation''`)`

Causes ''translation'' to be installed as the default translation.

`(installed-translation)`

Return the currently installed translation object.

Note:  The name &quot;blob&quot; is subject to change.
