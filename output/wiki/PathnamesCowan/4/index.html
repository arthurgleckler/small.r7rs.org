      <h2 id="Pathnames">Pathnames</h2>
      <p>Pathnames are immutable record-style objects of a disjoint type that represent the natural components of (string) filenames in a way that is intended to be system-independent.  This design is mostly based on MIT Scheme, which is mostly based on Common Lisp.  However, it is extended to accept additional components which are required to represent URIs and IRIs as well as filenames.  In addition, given the pervasiveness of Windows and Posix filenames nowadays, specific provisions for them has been made.</p>
      <h2 id="Componentsandtheiraccessors">Components and their accessors</h2>
      <p>The components of a pathname are <i>scheme</i>, <i>host</i>, <i>port</i>, <i>username</i>, <i>password</i>, <i>device</i>, <i>directory</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>type</i>, <i>version</i>, <i>query</i>, and <i>fragment</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Scheme</i> is the scheme part of a URI/IRI.  It is a string.</p>
      <p><i>Username</i> is the username associated with a URI/IRI host.  It is a string.</p>
      <p><i>Password</i> is the password associated with a <i>username</i>.  It is a string.</p>
      <p><i>Host</i> is the host part of a URI/IRI, the server part of a UNC name, or the host part of a Berkeley-style host:pathname.  It is a string.</p>
      <p><i>Port</i> is the port part of a URI/IRI.  It is an exact integer.</p>
      <p><i>Device</i> is a Windows-style device name without a trailing colon.  It is a string, typically but not always a single character.</p>
      <p><i>Directory</i> is a directory path, which is represented as a list.  The first element is always a symbol, either <span class="monospace">absolute</span> or <span class="monospace">relative</span>, representing pathnames relative to the system root or the current directory respectively.  The root directory is represented by the list <span class="monospace">(absolute)</span>.  A null directory path is represented by the empty list.  The other elements are strings.</p>
      <p><i>Name</i> is a simple file name without the associated file type or extension, if any.  It is a string.</p>
      <p><i>Type</i> is the type or extension of the filename, without any leading period.  It is a string.</p>
      <p><i>Version</i> specifies the version of a file.  It is normally an exact positive integer, where 1 represents the oldest possible version.  The symbols <span class="monospace">oldest</span> and <span class="monospace">newest</span> represent the oldest and newest existing versions.</p>
      <p><i>Query</i> is the query part of a URI/IRI.  It may be an a-list mapping strings to strings, or a simple string.</p>
      <p><i>Fragment</i> is the fragment part of an IRI/URI.  It is a string.</p>
      <p>All of these components can also be <span class="monospace">#f</span> to indicate that the component is not present.</p>
      <h2 id="Basicprocedures">Basic procedures</h2>
      <p>The procedures <span class="monospace">pathname?</span> and <span class="monospace">pathname=?</span> do what you expect.  Note that two pathnames may be different according to <span class="monospace">pathname=?</span> but still access the same resource.  Host components are compared case-insensitively.</p>
      <h2 id="Accessors">Accessors</h2>
      <p>There are twelve accessors corresponding to the twelve components of a pathname, which take the form <span class="monospace">pathname-*</span> where <span class="monospace">*</span> is one of the components.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-query-as-string </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the query component as a string.  If it is already a string, the string is returned.  If it is an a-list, the a-list is converted into a string containing name-value pairs separated by <span class="monospace">&amp;</span> and with <span class="monospace">=</span> between the name and the value.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-directory-as-string </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>options</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the directory component as a string.  <i>Options</i> is a list of symbols that may contain <span class="monospace">windows</span>; if it contains other symbols, the result is implementation-specified.  The result consists of the strings in the <i>cdr</i> of the directory component joined using the path separator, with the separator prepended if the <i>car</i> is <span class="monospace">absolute</span>.  If <span class="monospace">windows</span> is present in <i>options</i>, the path separator is <span class="monospace">\</span>; otherwise, the path separator is '/'.</p>
      <p>It is an error to mutate anything returned by any of these accessors.</p>
      <h2 id="Constructorsandparsers">Constructors and parsers</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-pathname </span><i>components</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a pathname.  <i>Components</i> is an a-list mapping component names to values.  Component names not defined in this specification are allowed, but the results are implementation-specific.  Any component names not appearing in <i>components</i> are set to <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <p>The following procedures accept a string and construct and return a pathname corresponding to that string.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(filename-&gt;pathname </span><i>filename</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>options</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a pathname.  <i>Filename</i> is a string to be converted to a filename.  <i>Options</i> is a list of symbols that may include <span class="monospace">windows</span>, <span class="monospace">version</span> and/or <span class="monospace">host</span>.  Other symbols may be present, but the result is implementation-dependent.</p>
      <p>If <span class="monospace">version</span> is present in <span class="monospace">options</span>, then if <i>filename</i> ends in <span class="monospace">.~</span><i>n</i><span class="monospace">~</span>, where <i>n</i> is a positive integer, then that suffix is stripped off and the version component is set to <i>n</i>.  Otherwise, if <i>filename</i> ends in <span class="monospace">~</span>, then it is stripped off and the version' component is set to <span class="monospace">oldest</span>.  Otherwise, or if <span class="monospace">version</span> is not present, then the version component is set to <span class="monospace">newest</span>.</p>
      <p>If <span class="monospace">windows</span> is not present and <span class="monospace">host</span> is present, and there is a colon in <i>filename</i>, then the portion before the colon is stripped off and used to populate the host component.  If <span class="monospace">windows</span> is present and <i>filename</i> begins with <span class="monospace">\\</span> or <span class="monospace">//</span>, its first portion is stripped off and used to populate the host component.  Otherwise, the host component is set to <span class="monospace">&quot;localhost&quot;</span>.</p>
      <p>If <span class="monospace">windows</span> is not present in <i>options</i>, then <i>filename</i> is parsed using <span class="monospace">/</span> as the component separator, and the directory, name, and type components are potentially populated from it, and the device component is set to <span class="monospace">#f</span>.  But if <span class="monospace">windows</span> is present, then <i>filename</i> is parsed using both <span class="monospace">\</span> and <span class="monospace">/</span> as component separators, and the device, directory, name, and type components are potentially populated from it.</p>
      <p>Finally, the scheme component is set to <span class="monospace">&quot;file&quot;</span>, and the username, password, port, query, and fragment components are set to <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(uri-&gt;pathname </span><i>uri</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a pathname.  <i>Uri</i> is a string to be converted to a pathname.  It is parsed according to IRI rules, which are the same as URI rules except that sequences of <span class="monospace">%</span>-hexdigit-hexdigit escapes that represent UTF-8 byte sequences are parsed into characters, provided the requisite characters are supported by the implementation.</p>
      <p>The scheme, host, port, username, password, directory, name, type, query, and fragment components are potentially populated from <i>uri</i>.  The device and version components are set to <span class="monospace">#f</span>.  If the query part of the IRI consists of name-value pairs separated by <span class="monospace">&amp;</span> or <span class="monospace">;</span> and with <span class="monospace">=</span> between the name and the value, then the query component will be an a-list of strings; otherwise, it will just be a string.</p>
      <h2 id="Deconstructors">Deconstructors</h2>
      <p>The following procedures accept a pathname and construct and return a string corresponding to that pathname.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-&gt;filename </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>options</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a string from <i>pathname</i>.  <i>Options</i> is a list of symbols that may include <span class="monospace">windows</span>, <span class="monospace">version</span> and/or <span class="monospace">host</span>; however, <span class="monospace">version</span> and <span class="monospace">host</span> are ignored.  Other symbols may be present, but the result is implementation-dependent.</p>
      <p>If <span class="monospace">windows</span> is not present in <i>options</i>, then the result is constructed using <span class="monospace">/</span> as the component separator from the directory (using <span class="monospace">directory-as-string</span>), name, and type components of <i>pathname</i>, and if the host component is not <span class="monospace">#f</span> or <span class="monospace">&quot;localhost&quot;</span>, then its value and a colon are prepended to the result.  But if <span class="monospace">windows</span> is present, then the result is constructed using <span class="monospace">\</span> as the component separator from the host, device, directory (using <span class="monospace">directory-as-string</span>), name, and type components.</p>
      <p>If the version component is an exact positive integer <i>n</i>, then <span class="monospace">.~</span><i>n</i><span class="monospace">~</span> is appended to the result.  Otherwise, if the version component is <span class="monospace">oldest</span>, then <span class="monospace">~</span> is appended to the result.</p>
      <p>It is an error if the scheme component is not set to <span class="monospace">&quot;file&quot;</span>, or the username, password, port, query, and fragment components are not <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-&gt;uri </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a string according to RFC 3986 rules.  In addition to required <span class="monospace">%</span>-escaping, non-ASCII characters are converted to UTF-8 byte strings and <span class="monospace">%</span>-escaped.</p>
      <p>The scheme, host, port, username, password, directory (using <span class="monospace">directory-as-string</span>), name, type, query (using <span class="monospace">query-as-string</span>), and fragment components are used to construct the URI.  It is an error if the device and version components are not <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-&gt;iri </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a string according to RFC 3987 rules.  No escaping of non-ASCII characters is done.</p>
      <p>The scheme, host, port, username, password, directory (using <span class="monospace">directory-as-string</span>), name, type, query (using <span class="monospace">query-as-string</span>), and fragment components are used to construct the URI.  It is an error if the device and version components are not <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="Otherprocedures">Other procedures</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(merge-pathnames </span><i>pathname1</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>pathname2</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a new pathname with the same components as <i>pathname1</i>.  However, if any component of <i>pathname1</i> is <span class="monospace">#f</span>, the corresponding component of <i>pathname2</i> is used instead.  The directory component is handled specially; if the <i>pathname1</i> component begins with <span class="monospace">relative</span>, the rest of it is appended to the <i>pathname2</i> component.  Similarly, if the query components are both a-lists, the a-list of <i>pathname1</i> is prepended to the a-list of <i>pathname2</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-absolute-filename? </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>options</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>pathname</i> specifies an absolute filename.  If <span class="monospace">windows</span> is contained in <i>options</i>, that means the device component must be specified.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-absolute-uri? </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>options</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>pathname</i> specifies an absolute URI.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pathname-uri? </span><i>pathname</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>options</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>pathname</i> specifies a URI/IRI (that is, <i>pathname</i> specifies an absolute URI and the fragment component is <span class="monospace">#f</span>).</p></div></body></html>
