    <pre>I (John Cowan) have extracted the following formal and informal objections to draft 9 of R7RS-small from votes cast in the R7RS-small plebiscite (and a few other email messages), and filed a ticket for each: the tickets are linked via their numbers.

* #478: Procedure equivalence should return.
* #479: Character names like 'xbeef' can be read two ways
* #480: Mapper output can share storage with input(s)
* #481: Draft is gratuitously incompatible with R6RS
* #482: Module system is pointlessly inflexible
* #483: Top-level semantics unspecified
* #484: The draft avoids making hard decisions
* #485: Many decisions were based on a tacit requirement to ignore R6RS
* #486: The draft is a step backwards from R6RS
* #487: The draft is not true to the spirit of Scheme
* #488: The draft is a move away from unity
* #489: The draft has little to offer over R5RS
* #490: The draft has little to offer over R6RS
* #491: Library versions, a pedagogically important feature, are not provided
* #492: Assertions are not provided
* #493: Full Unicode support is not portable
* #494: Including/loading doesn't belong in Scheme
* #495: The draft lacks many important libraries
* #496: Catastrophic failure should not be acceptable
* #497: The Scheme community is broken
* #498: Does the world need a better R5RS?
* #499: The draft is less expressive than (rnrs base 6)
* #500: &quot;The &quot;&quot;stack winding dance&quot;&quot; of guard clauses&quot;
* #501: Mutable strings are still provided
* #502: Call/cc should go
* #503: Setters should be allowed to return zero values
* #504: The treatment of sequences is still flawed
* #505: Internal definitions other than by define are problematic
* #506: Process issue: Late changes were not reviewable
* #507: R6RS/R7RS incompatibility of bytevector-copy! procedure
* #508: Library syntax should have been a subset of R6RS
* #509: Problematic interactions between dynamic-wind and exceptions
* #510: SRFI 9 records shouldn't be universal
* #511: Parameters shouldn't be in the core
* #512: Parameters should be used instead of proliferating names
* #513: Error should have been R6RS-compatible
* #514: New module syntax is ugly and unnecessary
* #515: Cond-expand doesn't scale and is hard to use
* #516: The lack of a fully-featured macro system requires sub-par constructs
* #517: The draft doesn't support user extensibility
* #518: The R7RS-small text should have been founded on the R6RS text
* #519: Toy Schemes shouldn't be the measure of what belongs in the standard
* #520: A library with no export declarations should export everything
* #521: Make library contents be at top level
* #522: WG1 was forbidden to remove restrictions
* #523: R7RS-large should have preceded R7RS-small
* #524: The draft's text-handling procedures are wrong in a Unicode world
* #525: Adding Unicode is too big a change from R5RS
* #526: #true and #false considered gratuitous
* #527: Block comment syntax considered unsightly
* #528: #!(no-)fold-case considered ugly
* #529: Read-line permits DoS attacks
* #530: The draft is too conservative in its changes to R5RS
* #531: Eq? should not be called an equivalence predicate
* #532: Delaying multiple values shouldn't be undefined
