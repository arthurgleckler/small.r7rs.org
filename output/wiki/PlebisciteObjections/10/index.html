      <ul>
        <li>Adding Unicode support is too large a change from R5RS.
          <ul>
            <li>It is still possible for a Scheme to provide ASCII-only support; the only constraint is that it must be done in a way that extends smoothly to the rest of the Unicode repertoire.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Exceptions integrate badly with the rest of the language.
          <ul>
            <li>Perhaps that is because they are pure R6RS.  We can't do it all.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The syntaxes <span class="monospace">#true</span> and <span class="monospace">#false</span> are totally gratuitous.
          <ul>
            <li>They add a little extra readability, but are optional.  Early versions of the Scheme standard provided them in the forms <span class="monospace">#!true</span> and <span class="monospace">#!false</span>.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The lexical syntax <span class="monospace">#| ... |#</span> is unsightly.
          <ul>
            <li>A matter of taste.  Many Schemes provide it already, including R6RS.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The lexical syntax <span class="monospace">#!(no-)fold-case</span> is a bit ugly.
          <ul>
            <li>It is R6RS-compatible and fairly clear.  The alternatives <span class="monospace">#cs</span> (case sensitive) and <span class="monospace">#ci</span> are less widely standardized and less intuitively clear.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The <span class="monospace">read-line</span> procedure can cause a denial of service because it does not provide for a limit on the amount of input read.
          <ul>
            <li>True.  However, <span class="monospace">read</span> has the same problem.  It's easy for an implementation that worries about this sort of thing to provide an optional second argument setting a limit.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The draft should reflect the intersection of high-quality industrial-strength implementations, not the intersection of every toy Scheme ever written.
          <ul>
            <li>Which implementations are those?  Schemers disagree.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The <span class="monospace">call/cc</span> abstraction is intractable and not useful and should have been excluded.
          <ul>
            <li>The WG did not believe that the very high bar for removing an IEEE Scheme feature was met.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The draft was forbidden by its charter to remove restrictions that make additional features seem necessary.
          <ul>
            <li>If the restrictions in question were hard-coded into R5RS, and removing them would break backward compatibility, then yes.  Restrictions that could be removed without breaking backward compatibility could be and sometimes were removed; for example, the restriction that <span class="monospace">load</span> loads into the interaction environment only.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The large language should have been developed before the small language.
          <ul>
            <li>This objection is untimely.  In addition, developing a large language and then subsetting it would have a higher overall risk of failure; if the large language was never completed, the small language would not exist.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The text-handling routines are redundant or inelegant in a Unicode world, but could not be removed or fundamentally altered due to charter restrictions.
          <ul>
            <li>Scheme would probably be better off not treating strings as sequences of characters, but rather treating characters as a special case of strings.  Unfortunately, that's too far away from the IEEE model.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The interaction between exceptions, <span class="monospace">dynamic-wind</span>, and continuations is missing something orthogonal.
          <ul>
            <li>This objection is too vague to meet head-on.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The draft made many matters settled by R6RS undefined again.
          <ul>
            <li>Since R6RS support never became pervasive, these matters were in practice not defined in a way that Schemers could rely on, unless they used only R6RS-compatible implementations.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The order of arguments in the draft's <span class="monospace">bytevector-copy</span> is fundamentally incompatible with R6RS in an undetectable way, though it is R6RS that is wrong here.
          <ul>
            <li>True and unfortunate, but the draft's approach is consistent with the rest of Scheme.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The draft should have included delimited continuation support.
          <ul>
            <li>The large language will provide it.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The draft does not provide procedures that operate on mixed types of sequences (e.g. a map function that accepts a list and a vector and applies a two-argument function element-wise on them).
          <ul>
            <li>True.  Unfortunately, no one proposed them during the working life of WG1.</li></ul></li>
        <li>The draft is too conservative in its changes to R5RS.
          <ul>
            <li>That was a charter requirement.</li></ul></li>
        <li><a href="/ticket/467">#467</a> should not be reverted.</li>
        <li>The storage model should return to saying &quot;equivalent in the sense of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>&quot; rather than &quot;operationally equivalent&quot;.</li></ul></div></body></html>
