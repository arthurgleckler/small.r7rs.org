      <h3 id="#460Semanticsof`eqv?`"><a href="/ticket/460">#460</a> Semantics of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span></h3>
      <p>Earlier we voted on <a href="/ticket/125">#125</a>, <a href="/ticket/229">#229</a> and <a href="/ticket/345">#345</a> separately without regard to
the formal semantics of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> from a top level.  We need to first
decide what the definition of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> is, and consider if there should
be any exception cases as a secondary effect.</p>
      <p>The debate is fundamentally one of whether we define <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> in terms
of &quot;operational equivalence&quot; as in R6RS or a simpler rule
(e.g. resolve by <span class="monospace">=</span>) as in earlier standards.</p>
      <p>R2RS had the simplest historical rule which was simply to use <span class="monospace">=</span>.</p>
      <p>The term &quot;operational equivalence&quot; appears in R3RS but for numbers the
definition is the same as in R4RS and R5RS, which is <span class="monospace">=</span> plus the same
exactness.  This is the <span class="monospace">r5rs</span> option.</p>
      <p>R6RS defines two numbers to be &quot;operationally equivalent&quot; (and
therefore <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>) if they would return the same results for any finite
composition of &quot;Scheme's standard arithmetic procedures&quot;.  Presumably
this refers to everything in section 11.7 &quot;Arithmetic&quot;, but not, for
example, <span class="monospace">write</span>.  For R7RS this would be equivalent to all the
standard procedures in the &quot;Numbers&quot; section 6.2.6, and is called the
<span class="monospace">r6rs</span> option.  Alternately, the equivalence rules could include any
procedure the implementation provides (such as <span class="monospace">decode-float</span>) - this
is the <span class="monospace">r6rs/all</span> option.  Operational equivalence is very desirable
when implementing caches and programs which reason about programs.</p>
      <p>In contrast to R6RS, R7RS does not require the full numeric tower.
This means that any definition of operational equivalence would render
many numbers unspecified from the perspective of the standard, yet
users could rely on consistency within their own implementation, and
broad agreement amongst most implementations which provide the full
tower.  For example, <span class="monospace">(eqv? 1/3 (/ 3.0))</span> is unspecified under any
definition, because exact ratios may not be supported.  However,
<span class="monospace">(eqv? 0.0 -0.0)</span> is specified and required to return <span class="monospace">#t</span> under the
<span class="monospace">r5rs</span> rule, yet is unspecified under the <span class="monospace">r6rs</span> rule - it would
return <span class="monospace">#f</span> for implementations which distinguish <span class="monospace">-0.0</span> from <span class="monospace">0.0</span>
and <span class="monospace">#t otherwise</span>.  Under <span class="monospace">r6rs/all</span>, <span class="monospace">(eqv? 0.0 -0.0)</span> should
return <span class="monospace">#f</span> under any implementation which would at least write <span class="monospace">-0.0</span>
with the leading minus sign.  Any notation using precision specifiers
would also has undefined equivalence under the <span class="monospace">r6rs</span> rule, e.g.
<span class="monospace">(eqv? 1e0 1f0)</span>.</p>
      <p>Finally, some Schemes (MIT, Gambit, Chibi, STklos) allow
mixed-exactness complex numbers: that is, <span class="monospace">(imag-part 1.0+2i)</span> returns <span class="monospace">2</span>
rather than <span class="monospace">2.0</span>.  Under <span class="monospace">r5rs</span>, <span class="monospace">(eqv? 1.0+2i 1.0+2.0i)</span> returns
<span class="monospace">#t</span>, because these numbers are <span class="monospace">=</span> and both inexact.  Under <span class="monospace">r6rs</span> and
<span class="monospace">r6rs/all</span>, however, it returns <span class="monospace">#f</span> because <span class="monospace">imag-part</span> returns
a different value when applied to each argument.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind the semantics of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> also affect <span class="monospace">memv</span>, <span class="monospace">assv</span> and
<span class="monospace">case</span>.</p>

      <h3 id="#229eqv?andNaN"><a href="/ticket/229">#229</a> eqv? and NaN</h3>
      <p>As announced previously this is being re-opened due to incorrect
formulation in the previous ballot, and in response to formal comment
<a href="/ticket/423">#423</a>.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the result of <a href="/ticket/460">#460</a>, the semantics implies that <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>
return <span class="monospace">#f</span> on comparing any two NaN objects.  It is reasonable to
want to consider any two NaNs as the &quot;same&quot; since they behave the same
under any operation, even though none of the results are <span class="monospace">=</span>.  Moreover,
it is very common to use a shortcut <span class="monospace">eq?</span> pointer comparison before
falling back on general <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> logic.  In deference to this R6RS makes
an exception and allows the result to be unspecified, and we should
consider allowing this exception.</p>
      <p>The &quot;same&quot; options from previous ballots have been removed, pending an
alternate formulation of the semantics of <a href="/ticket/460">#460</a> in which this would
make sense.</p>
      <p>The default of <span class="monospace">unspecified</span> still holds from the previous invalidated
ballot.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> different, unspecified, undecided</li>
        <li><b>Default:</b> unspecified</li>

      <h3 id="#125Allowproceduresnottobelocations(makingEQV?unspecifiedinsomeadditionalcases)"><a href="/ticket/125">#125</a> Allow procedures not to be locations (making EQV? unspecified in some additional cases)</h3>
      <p>Procedures are another case for contention with <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>.  In R3RS, an
operational equivalence was defined for procedures, and this was
subsequently removed.</p>
      <p>R6RS went the other direction and allowed the exact same procedure <span class="monospace">x</span>
to return <span class="monospace">#f</span> for <span class="monospace">(eqv? x x)</span>, and R7RS currently reaffirms this.
The rationale behind this is for compiler optimizations such as
inlining local procedures, that is given:</p><span class="monospace">(let ((square (lambda (x) (* x x))))
  (eqv? square square))
</span>
      <p>it is reasonable for a compiler to perform the optimization:</p><span class="monospace">(eqv? (lambda (x) (* x x)) (lambda (x) (* x x)))
</span>
      <p>in which case the result would naturally return <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>

      <h3 id="#393Definingrecordequality"><a href="/ticket/393">#393</a> Defining record equality</h3>
      <p>Currently, R7RS-small says that when <span class="monospace">equal?</span> is applied to records
that are not <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> (that were constructed by different calls to the
record constructor), the result may be <span class="monospace">#t</span> or <span class="monospace">#f</span> at the
implementation's discretion.  The proposal is to treat records of the same
type like pairs, strings, vectors, and bytevectors: that is, their
contents are recursively compared.</p>
      <p>Vote <span class="monospace">recursive</span> to require recursive comparison of the record's
fields, <span class="monospace">identity</span> to return <span class="monospace">#t</span> iff <span class="monospace">eqv?</span> does, and <span class="monospace">unspecified</span>
to leave this open.</p>
      <p>Note <span class="monospace">equal?</span> is already required to handle cycles regardless.</p>

      <h3 id="#306Whatdoes&quot;fullUnicode&quot;supportmeaninAppendixB?"><a href="/ticket/306">#306</a> What does &quot;full Unicode&quot; support mean in Appendix B?</h3>
      <p>Specifically, does it indicate case-folding and normalization support
for the repertoire of any particular version of Unicode, or any
version greater than 5 or 6 or 6.1, or no particular version?</p>
      <p>Full unicode refers to the set of characters available.  Case-folding
and character predicates are required to work according to the Unicode
standard for all supported characters.  The question of which version
of Unicode the property refers to is important.  We could require a
specific version (and all further revisions), or always require the
latest official Unicode standard, in which case an implementation
would not be compliant until it was updated with each new standard.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> at-least-6, at-least-6.1, latest, undecided, unspecified</li>
        <li><b>Default:</b> unspecified</li>

      <h3 id="#458Removetheformalsemanticsfromthereport"><a href="/ticket/458">#458</a> Remove the formal semantics from the report</h3>
      <p>There have been a bunch of complaints about the formal semantics: it's
incomplete, it cannot be mechanized with a proof assistant, it doesn't
help either users or implementers very much, and so on.  See in
particular <a href="/ticket/453">#453</a>.</p>
      <p>The semantics have been updated to include <span class="monospace">dynamic-wind</span>, however the
other arguments still hold.</p>
      <p>This proposal is to remove it from the report altogether, and to urge
the Steering Committee to create a new WG to produce one, likely in a
&quot;rolling&quot; style with increasingly comprehensive releases, on its own
schedule.  Some members of the current WG have expressed interest in
serving on such a group, and others have expressed their complete lack
of interest, so a new WG seems the best choice if this is done.</p>
      <p>Alternately, we can adapt the operational semantics from R6RS.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> remove, keep, operational, undecided</li>

      <h3 id="#398Allowrepeatedkeysin`case`"><a href="/ticket/398">#398</a> Allow repeated keys in <span class="monospace">case</span></h3>
      <p>R5RS says it's an error for a key to appear in more than one clause of
<span class="monospace">case</span> (or twice in the same clause, but that's trivial).  R6RS allows
the same key to appear more than one clause, but insists on
left-to-right testing throughout, like <span class="monospace">cond</span>.  The R6RS editors
thought this was better for machine-generated code, though worse for
hand-written code.</p>
      <p>The proposal is a compromise: allow keys to appear in more than one clause,
but behave as if the key appeared only in the first (leftmost) clause.
This allows hash-table or other non-left-to-right implementations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> r5rs, r6rs, leftmost, unspecified, undecided</li>
        <li><b>Default:</b> r5rs</li>

      <p>Following exactly in the footsteps of R6RS we voted for a <span class="monospace">blob</span> API
and then changed the name to <span class="monospace">bytevector</span>.</p>
      <p>Formal comment <a href="/ticket/435">#435</a> argues that <span class="monospace">u8vector</span> is in more common use, so
this item is being re-opened.  The default is the current draft
<span class="monospace">bytevector</span>, and for any member leaving the preferences are left
blank their votes from ballot 3 will be used.</p>
      <ul>

      <h3 id="#353Nousebeforeimportinlibraries"><a href="/ticket/353">#353</a> No use before import in libraries</h3>
      <p>For ease of implementation, the proposal is to make it an error for an
imported identifier to be referenced or defined in a library before
the library declaration that imports it.  This allows strict
left-to-right processing of library declarations, with no need to
delay processing till the end of the library.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this would be an error (but still permitted as an extension
in Schemes that can easily provide it):</p><span class="monospace">(module
  (begin (define x y))
  (import (library defining y))
</span>
      <p>This would necessitate replacing the penultimate paragraph of section</p>
      <ol class="number" start="5">
        <li>5.1 with:</li></ol>
      <p>One possible implementation of libraries is as follows: After all
<span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> library declarations are expanded, a new environment is
constructed for the library consisting of all imported bindings. The
expressions and declarations from all <span class="monospace">begin</span>, <span class="monospace">include</span>, and
<span class="monospace">include-ci</span> declarations are expanded in that environment in the
order in which they occur in the library declaration.  Alternatively,
<span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> and <span class="monospace">import</span> declarations may be processed in left to
right order interspersed with the processing of expressions and
declarations, with the environment growing as imported bindings are
added to it by each <span class="monospace">import</span> declaration.</p>
      <p>Vote <span class="monospace">yes</span> to add the restriction, or <span class="monospace">no</span> to leave it out.</p>

      <p>Add the following text to the discussion of library loading:</p>
      <p>Regardless of the number of times that a library is loaded, each
 program or library that imports bindings from a library will receive
 bindings from a single loading of that library, regardless of the
 number of <span class="monospace">import</span> or <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> declarations in which it appears.</p>
      <p>to make it clear that, for example,</p><span class="monospace">(import (prefix (foo) 'foo:))
(import (only (foo) bar))
</span>
      <p>will cause <span class="monospace">bar</span> and <span class="monospace">foo:bar</span> to come from the same instantiation of
the library '(foo)'</p>

      <p>Add an export-all form to the library declaration that means &quot;export

      <p>The proposed <span class="monospace">include-library-declarations</span> allows a library to
incorporate a file containing arbitrary library declarations, not just
Scheme code (definitions and expressions).  This allows, for example,
the exports of a module to be written directly in the library file,
and its imports in a separate file.</p>
      <p>An alternative would be something like <span class="monospace">(export-from &lt;library&gt;)</span> to
export the same bindings as another library.  This does require the
clumsiness of actually defining the identifiers in the other library
if it is abstract.</p>

      <h3 id="#449Clarifylibraryloadingrules"><a href="/ticket/449">#449</a> Clarify library loading rules</h3>
      <p>R7RS currently says:</p>
      <p>Within a program, each imported library is loaded at least once, and,
 if imported by more than one program or library, may possibly be
 loaded additional times.</p>
      <p>Richard Kelsey thinks this is too liberal, and proposes:</p>
      <p>Regardless of the number of times that a library is loaded, each
 program or library that imports bindings from a library will receive
 bindings from a single loading of that library, regardless of the
 number of <span class="monospace">import</span> or <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> forms in which it appears.</p>
      <p>Aaron Hsu, however, thinks this is too restrictive, and proposes
(backed up by actual R6RS implementations):</p>
      <p>If a library's definitions are referenced in the expanded form of a
 program or library body, then that library must be loaded before the
 expanded program or library body is evaluated. This rule applies
 transitively.</p>
      <p>Similarly, during the expansion of a library, if a syntax keyword
 imported from a library is needed to expand the library, then the
 imported library must be visited before the expansion of the
 importing library.</p>

#!fold-case and #!no-fold-case reader extensions. In
both cases the terminology was lax and simply referred
to &quot;reader case sensitivity&quot;, and all discussion centered
around symbols, although in R6RS character names were
also effected.</p>
      <p>Case folding will apply to numeric literals, booleans and
bytevectors regardless, as they do in both R5RS and R6RS.
We need to clarify how character names and the case
folding directives themselves are handled.</p>

      <p>There is concern that the output of <span class="monospace">write</span> cannot be read by non-R7RS
implementations.  This is not a strict requirement, but is reasonable
if using simple sexp-based file/interchange formats.</p>
      <p>Specifically, even though there are no cycles in</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(let ((x (list 2))) (write (list x x)))</span></p>
      <p>it previously output &quot;((2) (2))&quot; but now outputs &quot;(<a href="/ticket/0">#0</a>=(2) <a href="/ticket/0">#0</a>#)&quot;.</p>
      <p>The WG concern is that R5RS write is unsafe, easily causing infinite
loops, and should therefore not be the default.  Thus we renamed this
&quot;write-simple&quot;, requiring programmers to know they are writing a
&quot;simple&quot; data structure up front.</p>
      <p>Arguably, there are three procedures desired:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>write-cyclic: uses labels only to avoid cycles</li>
        <li>write-shared: uses labels for all shared structure</li>
        <li>write-simple: won't use labels - it is an error to pass a cyclic structure</li></ul>
      <p>although even for <span class="monospace">write-shared</span> people sometimes want to treat
containers such as strings separately.</p>
      <p>Note the algorithms for detecting shared structure differ from those

the <span class="monospace">#t</span> and <span class="monospace">#f</span> syntax.</p>
      <p>In draft 4 we added these back in as aliases, without the &quot;!&quot; now
that tokens are required to be delimited so there would be no ambiguity.</p>
      <p>Some objections were made to the new syntax which generated

is the previous decision to add <span class="monospace">#true</span> and <span class="monospace">#false</span> as aliases.</p>
      <p>The primary objection is that boolean literals are very common,
and this introduces needless incompatibilities with non-R7RS
systems, and potential confusion in documentation.</p>
      <p>The counter-argument is that these are more readable and
friendly to beginners, and allow easy visual distinction in long lists
of booleans.  We retain full backwards compatibility and are
under no obligation for non-R7RS systems to be able to run R7RS code.</p>

don't support the alternative proposal to just say that any true value
reports success and only #f reports failure, for there is usually only
one kind of success (0 on Posix and Windows, &quot;&quot; on Plan 9, 2 on VMS)
and many kinds of failure.&quot;</p>
      <p>It is reasonable and convenient to use <span class="monospace">#t</span>/<span class="monospace">#f</span> as generic
success/failure for portable programs, with <span class="monospace">(exit)</span> as a shorthand
for the &quot;normal&quot; completion <span class="monospace">(exit #t)</span>.</p>
      <p>Another reasonable extension is fallback for certain success values
that the implementation cannot understand.  Specifically, <span class="monospace">0</span> is
commonly used for success on Posix systems, and the empty string &quot;&quot; as
success on Plan9.  We could require that if the implementation does
not know how to pass these value types (string or number) to the OS,
then it should recognize <span class="monospace">0</span> and <span class="monospace">&quot;&quot;</span> as true.  Any value other than
these which cannot be passed to the OS should be treated as a generic
error.  That way, a program written for Posix that alternatively uses
<span class="monospace">(exit 0)</span> and <span class="monospace">(exit &lt;n&gt;)</span> will still work as desired on a Plan9
system, only losing details of the type of failure (and likewise for
Plan9 programs running on Posix).</p>
      <p>In either case, unless someone makes a proposal to the contrary,

      <p>&quot;I have reluctantly come to the same conclusion as the R6RS editors:
that in a Scheme with libraries, <span class="monospace">scheme-report-environment</span> and
<span class="monospace">null-environment</span> don't make much sense.  They are not in IEEE Scheme
or R4RS, so there is no formal barrier to removing them.</p>
      <p>&quot;Semantically, <span class="monospace">scheme-report-environment</span> holds all the identifiers in
R5RS, excepting any which the implementation doesn't provide, like
<span class="monospace">make-rectangular</span> if it does not have complex numbers.
<span class="monospace">Null-environment</span>, on the other hand, contains only the syntax
keywords with none of the standard procedures: it is not an empty
environment.  R6RS preserves these procedures only in the R5RS
compatibility library, where they expose only R5RS content.</p>
      <p>&quot;When adapting the definition to R7RS, I changed
<span class="monospace">scheme-report-environment</span> to contain all the identifiers in all the
standard libraries that the implementation provides, and
<span class="monospace">null-environment</span> all the syntax keywords in those libraries.  This
was the best I thought I could do, but now I think that it provides
very little utility.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's possible to construct any specific environment you want by using
the <span class="monospace">environment</span> procedure, which turns a sequence of import-specs
into an environment.  In particular, we now have the <span class="monospace">(scheme r5rs)</span>

      <p>The definition of read-line allows implementation defined extensions
to the set of end of line sequences. This is arguably too loose, as an
implementation could define &quot;a&quot; as and end of line. On the other hand,
if we do want to leave this in it may make sense to remove &quot;\r&quot;, which
is no longer used in any contemporary OS.</p>
      <p>Vote <span class="monospace">no-extensions</span> to forbid implementation defined extensions,
<span class="monospace">no-return</span> to remove a single return from the list of required end of
lines, and <span class="monospace">none</span> to leave as-is.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> no-extensions, no-return, none, undecided</li>

      <h3 id="#452providedigit-valuesupportforhex-digits"><a href="/ticket/452">#452</a> provide digit-value support for hex-digits</h3>
      <p>In ballot 4, in symmetry with the new Unicode definition of
<span class="monospace">char-numeric?</span> and as an analog to CL's <span class="monospace">digit-char-p</span>, we provided
<span class="monospace">digit-value</span>.</p>
      <p>An informal comment was made questioning this procedure, and
suggesting if provided at all it be extended to hex digits.</p>
      <p>Vote <span class="monospace">ascii-hex</span> to support only the ASCII hex digits a-f,A-F (in
addition to full Unicode numeric digits), <span class="monospace">unicode-hex</span> to support all
Unicode variants of a-f,A-F (need to define formally), <span class="monospace">remove</span> to
remove <span class="monospace">digit-value</span> entirely, or <span class="monospace">keep</span> to keep as is.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> ascii-hex, unicode-hex, remove, keep, undecided</li>

      <h3 id="#411Referenceimplementation"><a href="/ticket/411">#411</a> Reference implementation</h3>
      <p>Our charter calls for one or more reference implementations.  As of
today, Chibi is very close to being so.  The proposal is to bless it
as a sample or model implementation, but not technically a reference
implementation -- if it disagrees with the standard, the standard
wins.</p>

      <p>in <span class="monospace">(scheme lists)</span> and <span class="monospace">(scheme records)</span>. We should decide
officially which is preferred.</p>
