      <h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
      <p>The idea of role-based access control (RBAC) is that there are <i>actions</i> that can or cannot be performed on <i>resources</i> by <i>principals</i>, depending on whether or not a principal belongs to a <i>role</i>.  Actions are named by symbols, and are typically things like <span class="monospace">read</span>, <span class="monospace">write</span>, <span class="monospace">modify</span>, and <span class="monospace">delete</span>, though they can be anything at all.  Principals and roles are also named by symbols.  When setting up a rulebase for use by RBAC, we specify the actions, principals, and roles.  We can also say that a principal belongs to a role, or that a role is a sub-role of another role (meaning that all principals belonging to the first role automatically also belong to the second role).</p>
      <p>A resource is named by a list of symbols representing a path in an abstract hierarchy.  When specifying that a role is <i>allowed</i> to perform an action on a resource, it is implicit that it is also allowed to perform the same action on any sub-resources.  For example, if role <span class="monospace">updater</span> is allowed to perform action <span class="monospace">write</span> on the resource <span class="monospace">(localhost pub)</span>, then it is also allowed to perform that action on the sub-resource <span class="monospace">(localhost pub canada)</span>.  However, if a role is specified as being <i>blocked</i> from taking a given action on a given resource, then the principals belonging to that role cannot perform that action on the specified resource or its sub-resources.  By default, all roles are blocked from performing any action on the empty resource named <span class="monospace">()</span>.  Resources are not declared in a rulebase, but are deduced from their presence in allow and block specifications.</p>
      <p>Finally, principals can be members of <i>groups</i>, and groups can belong to roles in the same way that principals can.  We determine if a principal belongs to a group based on a procedure specified for the group that returns the principals in the group.  A group also has a <i>lead member</i> declared for it; at query time, if a group's procedure says that the lead member is not part of the group, an error is signaled.</p>

      <p>Add the symbol <i>group</i> to <i>rulebase</i>, specifying <i>proc</i> as the procedure for retrieving and checking group membership
and <i>lead-member</i> for the lead member of the group.  If <i>all-members</i> is called with no arguments, it returns a list of all
the principals in the group.  If <i>member?</i> is called with one argument, a principal, it returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if the principal is a member of the
group and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
