      <h2 id="Immutabledata">Immutable data</h2>
      <p>This optional proposal is about managing data immutability.</p>
      <p>Scheme data is mutable by default (except self-evaluating one like numbers or symbols), additional functions creating/managing immutable data are proposed.</p>
      <p>In some case we wish to forbid change of some piece of data by further function call for instance.</p>
      <p>Immutability is not the same as constant, as the content of an immutable data may refer to mutable data, while any part of a constant data is constant.</p>
      <p>Primitives have to work on immutable data as on mutable one, except of course mutators which should return errors instead.</p>
      <p>All data is either a mutable one or an immutable one.</p>
      <h3 id="Associatedprocedures">Associated procedures</h3>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-immutable data)</span></p>
      <p>Returns an immutable data containing a copy of data.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(mutable? obj)</span></p>
      <p>Returns #t if obj is a mutable, otherwise returns #f.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(immutable-&gt;mutable obj)</span></p>
      <p>This is an error if obj is not an immutable, else it returns a mutable copy of the data contained in obj.</p>
      <h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3>
      <p>Copy in both direction is needed in order to avoid side-effect mutation. Of course if data is a literal or is computed &quot;in place&quot; (without content being the same as another variable) then copy is not needed.</p>
      <p>Of course it is impossible to mutate the value contained inside an 'immutable' object:</p><span class="monospace">(let ((a (make-immutable (list 1 2 3)))) (set-car! a 10) a) ;; Error
</span>
      <p>However the 'immutable' object itself could be mutated. For instance it is possible to mutate a variable like a list containing an 'immutable' object :</p><span class="monospace">(define av (vector (make-immutable (list 1 2 3))))
(vector-set! av 0 10) ;; Ok
</span>
      <h3 id="Problems">Problems</h3>
      <p>An immutable data is globally immutable. Another proposal is needed if someone wants more data access management.</p>
      <p>Do we need a proposal for defining constant data ?</p>
      <p>Do we add a toggle-immutability! (sic) function ?</p>
      <p>Helper functions to create immutable lists / tree may be added as sugar.</p>
      <h3 id="Implementationsandissues">Implementations and issues</h3>
      <p>Immutability tag bit: cost in space and in time as immutability has to be checked with mutators.
