    <pre>This is a proposed repository format for R7RS.  It is intended to address the major issues and leave room for growth.  The idea is that anyone can provide their own repository, and implementations can write their own tools (or modify existing ones) to download packages from a repo. 

There will be a central repo and a common tool which will aim to support all R7RS 
implementations.

;; A minimal repository describing a single package containing two
;; libraries.  The tarball must expand to a single directory, and the
;; paths, pointing to files containing a single `define-library' form,
;; are relative to that directory.

 ;; Descriptive time of how often this repository should automatically
 ;; be refreshed.  Tools should honor this recommendation, but may
 ;; override it in response to explicit update requests.  The duration
 ;; is expressed as an amount and a unit of time, which defaults to
 ;; `day'.  Other valid units are: second, minute, hour, week, month,
 ;; year.
 (refresh (amount 1) (unit-of-time day))

 ;; A sibling is a pointer to another repository, which the client may
 ;; choose to search as well.  The URL points to a file containing
 ;; another `repository' sexp.  The optional trust level is a real
 ;; number in [0..1] indicating the current repository's trust in the
 ;; sibling - the user's trust level is the product of all trust
 ;; levels along the shortest path to a source.  The default is 0.5.
 ;;
 ;; Siblings may be used to build a distributed network of
 ;; repositories, to split the current repository into several URLs
 ;; for performance (e.g. moving seldom changing packages or publisher
 ;; lists to a repo with a longer refresh), or to provide translated
 ;; versions of the repo.  Clients are free to ignore siblings and/or
 ;; maintain their own lists of repositories.

 ;; A package is a collection of one or more related libraries that
 ;; are installed together.  Any library-specified properties can be
 ;; included at the package level, and apply to all contained
 ;; libraries.  Note multiple entries for the same package can occur
 ;; in the same or other repository, and the fields should be merged
 ;; (or the tool should warn if they are incompatible).
 (package
  ;; The name of a package uses the same namespace as the library
  ;; names.  Often, common libraries will be grouped under a common
  ;; prefix, following a pattern such as (pet-name project lib1),
  ;; (pet-name project lib2), etc.  If the package name is not
  ;; provided, then the longest common prefix of the libraries may be
  ;; used provided it is unambiguous.  In particular, in the common
  ;; case that there is only a single library in the package, the
  ;; library and package have the same name.  If the longest common
  ;; prefix is empty, or could apply to multiple packages, then the
  ;; package can only be referred to by the individual library names.

  ;; Any number of checksums may be provided, and tools should require
  ;; confirmation or refuse to install for a package with an invalid
  ;; checksum.  Currently defined checksums include md5, sha1,
  ;; sha2224, sha256, sha384, sha12.  It is recommended all packages
  ;; use a sha256 checksum.  Checksums are always written as hex
  ;; strings.  Checksums always apply to the _unzipped_ tarball, so
  ;; that transparent recompression can be applied.

  ;; to downloading and as an additional checksum (since this is
  ;; a checksum this refers to the size of the unzipped tarball).

  ;; contains the identity of a publisher (discussed below), and an

;; multiple times.

;; library naming conventions.  The `depends' values use a variant of
;; this with optional version suffix.

;; `unit-of-time' uses a closed list of symbols.  `features',
;; `licenses' and `platforms' are semi-closed lists of symbols (users
;; can add new values as needed), and `keywords' is an open list of
;; symbols.

;; `amount', `count' and `size' are exact integers.  `trust', `mean'
;; and `median' are real numbers in the range [0..1], and `variance'
;; is a non-negative real number.

;; The remaining values are strings, all of which are opaque with the
;; following exceptions.  `url', `homepage', `manual' and
;; `screenshots' indicate an RFC 3986 URL.  `path' indicates a
;; filesystem path as an ASCII string - non-ASCII paths are currently
;; unsupported.  `version' indicates a Debian-style version string.
;; `created', `updated' and `expires' are RFC 3339 date-time strings.
;; `modulus', `exponent' and the checksum values and signatures are
;; hexidecimal strings.
