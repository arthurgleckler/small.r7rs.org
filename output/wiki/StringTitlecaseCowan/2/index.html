      <h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
      <p>This SRFI explains how to implement a Unicodely correct <span class="monospace">string-titlecase</span> procedure similar to those specified in <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-2.html#node_sec_1.2">R6RS</a> and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-13/srfi-13.html">SRFI 13</a>.  The algorithm does not depend on the availability of full Unicode, however, and will work just as well with a purely ASCII repertoire.</p>
      <p>Consider the string <span class="monospace">ﬂoo bar</span>, which begins with a ligature of the characters <span class="monospace">fl</span>.  The right way of titlecasing this string is to treat the ligature the same as <span class="monospace">fl</span>, in which case the result is <span class="monospace">Floo Bar</span>.  However, by the strict letter of R6RS, the <span class="monospace">ﬂ</span> character must be passed to <span class="monospace">char-titlecase</span>, which in this case will return its argument unchanged, and the result is <span class="monospace">ﬂoo Bar</span>.  What is more, if the <span class="monospace">ﬂ</span> character is not even seen as a casing letter, then the result will be <span class="monospace">ﬂOo Bar</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(string-titlecase </span><i>string</i> [ <i>start</i> [ <i>end</i> ] ]<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>When strict compatibility with R6RS is desired, the <i>start</i> and <i>end</i> arguments must not be supported.</p>
      <p>This procedure applies the Unicode full string lowercasing algorithm to the substring of its argument beginning with <i>start</i> and ending with <i>end</i>.  However, any character preceded by a non-cased character, or by no character at all, is processed by a different algorithm.  If it has a multi-character titlecase mapping, it is replaced by that mapping.  Otherwise, it is replaced by its single-character titlecase mapping.  Note that with four exceptions the single-character titlecase mapping is the same as the uppercase mapping.  The result of the application of these algorithms is returned.</p>
      <p>In certain cases, the result differs in length from the argument. If the result is equal to the argument in the sense of <span class="monospace">string=?</span>, the argument may be returned. Note that language-sensitive mappings are not used.</p></div></body></html>
