    <pre>These are the editorial corrections to the ninth draft in reverse order.  All are present in the tenth (post-ballot) draft.

* Rule out `xbeef` as a character name because it is a hex scalar value
* Restored R5RS results of `gen-counter` and `gen-loser`
* Cleaned up definition of &quot;variable definition&quot;
* Cleaned up zero-or-more values continuations language
* Falling off a `cond-expand` is now undefined behavior
* Minor typos fixed (thanks to Jussi Piitulainen)
* Corrected changes not to imply that character and string comparisons accept 0 or 1 arguments
* Added note about the order of arguments in R6RS vs. R7RS `bytevector-copy!`
* Restored reference to `eqv?` in the storage model (as opposed to &quot;operational equivalence&quot;)
* Improved allocation discussion to handle empty objects specially
* Changed &quot;as following&quot; to &quot;as follows&quot;
* Cleaned up all cases of &quot;forbidden in strings&quot; to be uniform
* Made the definitions of character comparisons defer to `char-&gt;integer` to handle non-Unicode
* Fixed quasiquotation and symbol-equality examples
* Removed procedure inequivalence from language changes list
* Squeeze vertical space to save a whole page
* Revert to R5RS equivalence semantics for procedures (substantive change per WG unanimity)
* Removed &quot;equal,&quot; from definition of `string&lt;?` and friends</pre>
