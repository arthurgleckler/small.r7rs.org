      <h2 id="Advancedprocedures">Advanced procedures</h2>
      <p>These procedures are mostly derived in function, and sometimes in name, from ISO/IEC 8485 and ISO 17351, which standardize basic and extended APL respectively.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-collapse </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>j</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Let <i>k</i> be the rank of <i>array</i>.  This procedure constructs and returns an array of rank <i>j</i>, which MUST be less than or equal to <i>k</i>, whose components are arrays of rank <i>k</i> - <i>j</i>.  The shape of the returned array is equal to the first <i>j</i> components of the shape of <i>array</i>, and the shapes of its subarrays are equal to the remaining <i>k</i>-<i>j</i> components.  (APL</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-explode </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>j</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Let <i>k</i> be the rank of <i>array</i>.  This procedure constructs and returns an array of rank <i>j</i>, which MUST be greater than or equal to <i>k</i>.  Each component of <i>array</i> MUST be an array of rank <i>j</i> - <i>k</i>, all of which MUST have the same shape.  The shape of the returned array is the shape of <i>array</i> concatenated with the shape of any of its components, and each component is the corresponding component of the corresponding subarray of <i>array</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-reshape </span><i>shape</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a new array of shape <i>shape</i> whose components in row-major order are the same (in the sense of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>) as the components of <i>array</i> in row-major order.  (APL reshape.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-reverse </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array with the same shape as <i>array</i>, but whose elements on the specified <i>axis</i> are reversed.  <i>Axis</i> must be a non-negative integer less than the rank of <i>array</i>.  (APL reverse.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-compress </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>booleans</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array with the same shape as <i>array</i> except possibly along the <i>axis</i> dimension.  The array is sliced along <i>axis</i> and the elements of <i>booleans</i> (a vector of boolean values) are used to decide which slices to incorporate into the result: if the corresponding boolean is <span class="monospace">#t</span>, the slice is incorporated, otherwise not.  (APL compress.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-expand </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>booleans</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>nil</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array with the same shape as <i>array</i> except possibly along the <i>axis</i> dimension.  <i>Array</i> is sliced along <i>axis</i> and the elements of <i>booleans</i> (which MUST be a vector of boolean values) are used to decide where, if anywhere, <i>nil</i> (which must have the same shape as a slice) is to be interpolated: if the corresponding boolean is <span class="monospace">#t</span>, <i>nil</i> is interpolated, otherwise the next slice is incorporated.  The size of <i>booleans</i> MUST be equal to the value of the <i>axis</i> dimension in the result.  (APL expand.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-rearrange </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>vector</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array with the same shape as <i>array</i>.  <i>Array</i> is sliced along the <i>axis</i> dimension, and the slices are reassembled in the order given by <i>vector</i>, which MUST be a vector of exact integers.  The slice whose number appears in the first element of <i>vector</i> appears first in the result, and so on.  (Generalized version of APL rotate.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-rearrange-axes </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>vector</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array whose shape is a permutation of the shape of <i>array</i>.  <i>Vector</i>, which MUST be a vector of exact integers, specifies how to permute it.  The axis whose number appears in the first element of <i>vector</i> appears as the first axis of the result, and so on.  (APL dyadic transpose with integer-valued vector.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(subarray </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>start-subscripts</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>end-subscripts</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a smaller array with the same rank as <i>array</i> whose elements begin at the &quot;lower left&quot; corner specified by the list <i>start-subscripts</i> and end at the &quot;upper right&quot; corner specified by the list <i>end-subscripts</i>.  (APL take and drop.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-recursive-ref </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>subscript</i> ...<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Applies <span class="monospace">array-ref</span> to the <i>array</i> using the first <i>i</i> subscripts, where <i>i</i> is the rank of <i>array</i>.  If there are more subscripts, the result MUST be an array. Apply <span class="monospace">array-ref</span> to the result using the next <i>j</i> subscripts, where <i>j</i> is the rank of the result.  Repeat until there are no more subscripts, returning the last result.  (APL enlist.)</p>
      <h2 id="Higher-orderprocedures">Higher-order procedures</h2>
      <p>These procedures are mostly derived in function, and sometimes in name, from ISO/IEC 8485 and ISO 17351, which standardize basic and extended APL respectively.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-reduce </span><i>proc</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array whose rank is one less than the rank of <i>array</i>, by combining all the elements along <i>axis</i> using <i>proc</i>, which MUST be a two-argument procedure.  The order and number of invocations of <i>proc</i> is unspecified.  If there is only one such element, it is unchanged.  (APL reduce.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-reduce-by-groups</span><i>proc</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>n</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array with the same rank as the rank of <i>array</i>, by combining all the groups of elements of length <i>n</i> along <i>axis</i> using <i>proc</i>, which MUST be a two-argument procedure.  The order and number of invocations of <i>proc</i> is unspecified.  If there is only one such group of elements, it is unchanged.  (APL N-wise reduction.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-scan </span><i>proc</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>axis</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array whose shape is the same as the shape of <i>array</i>.  Each element along <i>axis</i> is constructed by reducing (as if by <span class="monospace">array-reduce</span>) successive prefixes of the elements of <i>array</i> along that axis.  (APL scan.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-outer-product </span><i>proc</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array1</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array2</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array whose shape is the concatenation of the shapes of <i>array1</i> and <i>array2</i>.  Each component of the new array is the result of applying <i>proc</i> to every element of <i>array1</i> and every element of <i>array2</i>.  The order and number of invocations of <i>proc</i> is unspecified.  (APL outer product.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(array-inner-product </span><i>proc1</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>proc2</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array1</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>array2</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns an array whose shape is equal to the shape of <i>array1</i> without its last element concatenated with the shape of <i>array2</i> without its first element; these elements MUST be numerically equal.  It is an error if both arrays have rank 0.</p>
      <p>Each element of the result array results from applying <i>proc2</i> to the corresponding elements of the last vectors of <i>array1</i> and the first vectors of <i>array2</i> and then reducing them with <i>proc1</i> to a single value.  The order and number of invocations of the procedures is unspecified.</p>
      <p>In particular, if both arrays have rank 1, the last and first vectors are the whole of the arrays, and the result has rank 0; if both arrays have rank 2, the last vectors of <i>array1</i> are the column-wise vectors, and the first vectors of <i>array2</i> are the row-wise vectors, and the result has rank 2.  (APL inner product.)</p>
      <p>Example:  <span class="monospace">(array-inner-product + * #(1 2 3) #(4 5 6))</span> computes the usual dot product of <i>vector1</i> and <i>vector2</i>.</p></div></body></html>
