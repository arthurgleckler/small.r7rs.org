      <h3 id="#121Thesemanticsofexptforzerobaseshasbeenrefined"><a href="/ticket/121">#121</a> The semantics of expt for zero bases has been refined</h3>
      <p>The R5RS definition of expt is:</p><span class="monospace"> -- procedure: expt z1 z2
     Returns Z1 raised to the power Z2.  For z_1 ~= 0

                          z_1^z_2 = e^z_2 log z_1

     0^z is 1 if z = 0 and 0 otherwise.
</span>
      <p>however exponents with negative real parts are undefined.
R6RS attempted to clarify this with:</p><span class="monospace">     0.0^z is 1.0 if z = 0.0, and 0.0 if (real-part z) is positive.
     For other cases in which the first argument is zero, either
     an error is signalled or an unspecified number is returned.
</span>
      <p>(Ignore the change in exactness, which was strictly editorial
and the examples clarify that the rules ignore exactness.)</p>
      <p>This is unique in all the reports of a result either
signalling an error or returning a value.  The motivation
for this was because R6RS consistently removed uses of the
&quot;is an error&quot; terminology which would more naturally fit
this situation.</p>
      <p>An alternative, <span class="monospace">r5rs-error</span>, is to restore the &quot;is an error&quot;
text since we are not avoiding this in R7RS:</p><span class="monospace">     0.0^z is 1.0 if z = 0.0, and 0.0 if (real-part z) is positive.
     For other cases in which the first argument is zero, either
     an error is signalled or an unspecified number is returned.
</span>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> r5rs, r5rs-error, r6rs, undecided</li>
        <li><b>Default:</b> r6rs</li>
        <li><b>Preferences:</b> r5rs, r5rs-error, r6rs</li></ul>
      <p>Rationale: I'm voting r5rs until this ballot item is fixed, which I believe means changing the language associated with r5rs-error to say &quot;it is an error.&quot;  If that change is made, I'll put r5rs-error first.</p>
      <h3 id="#472clarifysemanticsofnon-librarylibrarydeclarations"><a href="/ticket/472">#472</a> clarify semantics of non-library library declarations</h3>
      <p>In items <a href="/ticket/91">#91</a>, <a href="/ticket/148">#148</a> and <a href="/ticket/150">#150</a> we voted to allow the
use of <span class="monospace">include</span>, <span class="monospace">include-ci</span> and <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span>
at the &quot;top-level&quot; respectively, but there remains
some confusion as to their semantics.</p>
      <p>Here &quot;top-level&quot; refers to repl and program body
top-levels, but not library bodies.</p>
      <p>One interpretation is that these behave like library
declarations, and can expand into <span class="monospace">import</span> forms.
In this case, for a purely static implementation of
R7RS libraries, they must first be statically scanned
from all top-level forms.  They cannot be used
outside the top-level, and are not even available
as bindings otherwise.  This is the <span class="monospace">declaration</span>
proposal.</p>
      <p>Another interpretation is that they are just normal
macros with the obvious definitions (cond-expand
in terms of the output of the <span class="monospace">features</span> macro),
are available in the <span class="monospace">(scheme base)</span> library, and
consequently can't be used to expand into <span class="monospace">import</span>
since imports have already been resolved.  This is
the <span class="monospace">syntax</span> proposal.</p>
      <p>Alternately, we could provide <span class="monospace">both</span>.  If you think
this is all too confusing you could also vote <span class="monospace">remove</span>,
to drop these extensions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Options:</b> declaration, syntax, both, remove</li>
        <li><b>Default:</b></li>
        <li><b>Preferences:</b> remove, syntax, declaration</li></ul>
      <p>Rationale: There's just too much confusion in this area.</p>
      <h3 id="#473librarydeclarationlocationsintop-level"><a href="/ticket/473">#473</a> library declaration locations in top-level</h3>
      <p>R6RS allows only a single library declaration, <span class="monospace">import</span>,
at the beginning of a program body, and this must
contain all imported libraries.</p>
      <p>Pending the result of ticket <a href="/ticket/472">#472</a> we may also allow
<span class="monospace">include(-ci)</span> and <span class="monospace">cond-expand</span> to expand into
imports, and so the single form restriction would not
make sense.  However, it would be reasonable to
restrict all library declarations to the beginning of
a program - the first non-declaration would begin
the real body.  This is the <span class="monospace">beginning-only</span> option.</p>
      <p>The advantage of the <span class="monospace">r6rs</span> proposal is that it would
not require any changes in existing R6RS program
loading implementations to support.  If the result of
ticket <a href="/ticket/472">#472</a> indicates multiple declaration types are
available this option would automatically become
invalid, so you don't need to vote against it on those
grounds.</p>
      <p>The advantage of the <span class="monospace">beginning-only</span> option is
that it becomes possible to statically determine
all program imports without expansion, which was
the primary motivation of a static library system.</p>
      <p>The final alternative is <span class="monospace">any-top-level</span>, which
allows these forms anywhere at the top-level,
possibly interspersed with definitions.  The advantage
of this is that you can cut&amp;paste repl sessions
(for which interspersed imports are always allowed)
as a program.  The disadvantage is that programs
can no longer be resolved separately from expansion.</p>
