      <h1 id="Design">Design</h1>
      <p>When a problem situation, or <i>exception</i>, is detected
either by the implementation or by a
user program, a representation of that situation called a <i>condition</i>
(which can be any Scheme object) is constructed, and the exception is
announced by an action called <i>signaling
the condition</i>.  This action allows a dynamically established <i>condition handler</i>
an opportunity to resolve the problem.  At any given time, only one handler
is active.</p>
      <p>When a condition is signaled, the active handler is called with one
argument, a condition which represents the situation.  The
handler function will execute in the dynamic environment of the call to
<span class="monospace">signal</span>, except that the current condition handler
becomes the <i>enclosing handler</i>, which is the handler that was current at the point that the
current handler function was established as the active handler.  This means that
a handler is not expected to handle conditions signaled within its dynamic extent.</p>
      <p>If a handler returns normally, any values it returns are discarded.
The enclosing handler is invoked on the condition instead, and this
operation may be repeated until there are no more handlers.
Escaping from handler control is performed by invoking a captured
continuation.  For example, a handler may return to the point where it was
signaled by invoking a continuation stored inside the condition.  Alternatively,
it may return to the point where it was bound by invoking a
continuation in a variable that is lexically visible to the handler.
In any case, the appropriate current handler will be restored as part of the
dynamic environment.</p>
      <p>The outermost condition handler is implementation-defined.  It generally invokes
a top-level exit continuation for the whole program, or the current
thread (if some concept of threading exists), possibly displaying
useful debugging information to some interested parties in some
implementation-specific way.  Implementations may provide
an interactive debugger that lets the programmer perform actions other
than invoking the top-level exit continuation, perhaps invoking retries
or other arbitrary continuations.</p>
      <p>See <a href="/wiki/StandardConditionPredicatesCowan">StandardConditionPredicatesCowan</a> for standard predicates and accessors useful
with implementation-defined conditions.</p>
      <h1 id="Procedures">Procedures</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">(current-condition-handler)</span></li></ul>
      <p>Returns the current condition handler.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">(with-condition-handler </span><i>handler</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>thunk</i><span class="monospace">)</span></li></ul>
      <p>Applies <i>thunk</i> within a dynamic environment in
which  `<span class="monospace">handler</span>` is the current condition handler.  The supplied handler is executed
in the dynamic environment of the call to <span class="monospace">signal</span> that signals the condition,
except that the condition handler which was in effect when <span class="monospace">with-condition-handler</span> was called is
reinstated for the dynamic extent of the handler.  So if it signals any conditions without
explicitly changing to a different dynamic environment through applying continuations,
they will be passed to the previous handler, not the same one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">(signal </span><i>object</i><span class="monospace">)</span></li></ul>
      <p>Signals the condition <i>object</i>.  Never returns normally.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">(error-in </span><i>who</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>message</i><span class="monospace">. </span> <i>irritants</i><span class="monospace">)</span></li></ul>
      <p>Constructs a condition and signals it.  Never returns normally.
This procedure is compatible with R6RS <span class="monospace">error</span>.</p>
      <p>The <span class="monospace">who</span> argument must be a string or a symbol that describes the procedure or operation that detected the exception. The <i>message</i> argument must be a string that describes the exceptional situation. The <i>irritants</i> should be the arguments to the operation that detected the operation, but may be any objects relevant to the exception.</p>
      <p>The predicates <span class="monospace">who-condition?</span>, <span class="monospace">message-condition?</span>
and <span class="monospace">irritants-condition?</span> return <span class="monospace">#t</span> on this condition.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">(error </span><i>message</i><span class="monospace">. </span> <i>irritants</i><span class="monospace">)</span></li></ul>
      <p>Constructs a condition and signals it.  Never returns normally.
This procedure is compatible with SRFI 23.</p>
      <p>The <i>message</i> argument must be a string that describes the exceptional situation. The <i>irritants</i> should be the arguments to the operation that detected the operation, but may be any objects relevant to the exception.</p>
      <p>The predicates <span class="monospace">message-condition?</span>
and <span class="monospace">irritants-condition?</span> return <span class="monospace">#t</span> on this condition.</p>
