      <h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
      <p><i>Parallel promises</i>, known to Racketeers as <i><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/futures.html">futures</a></i>, are
analogous to ordinary Scheme promises, except that implementations are allowed to execute part or all of a promise
in parallel with regular execution.  An ordinary promise is not evaluated (and does not perform any side effects)
until it is forced, whereas parallel promises may be evaluated either completely or up to an implementation-determined
point when they are created.  If any evaluation is left to do when a parallel promise is forced, it is done
at that time.</p>
      <p>A parallel promise, unlike a thread, is intended to provide parallelism for potentially limited computations.
It performs its work in parallel (assuming that support for parallelism is available) until it detects
an attempt to perform an operation that is too complex for the system to run safely in parallel.  The list
of such operations is necessarily implementation-dependent.  Similarly, work on a parallel promise is suspended
if it depends in some way on the current continuation, such as raising an exception.</p>
      <p>Parallel promises are not intended to be used for concurrency, so there are no facilities for mutual exclusion.
A computation in a parallel promise might use <span class="monospace">set!</span> to modify a shared variable, in which case concurrent
assignment to the variable can be visible in other parallel promises or threads. Furthermore, guarantees
about the visibility of effects and ordering are determined by the operating system and hardware â€” which rarely support,
for example, any guarantee of sequential consistency.
At the same time, operations that seem obviously safe may have a complex enough implementation internally
that they cannot run in parallel on a particular implementation.</p>
      <h2 id="Issues">Issues</h2>
      <p>1) Use &quot;future&quot; instead of &quot;parallel promise&quot; along with the Racket names?</p>
      <p>2) Always hyphenate rather than using CL conventions?</p>
      <p>3) Spell out 'parallel' in names?</p>
      <h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(pardelay </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">)</span> [syntax]</p>
      <p>Semantics: The <span class="monospace">pardelay</span> construct is used together with
the procedure <span class="monospace">parforce</span> to implement potentially parallel evaluation
<span class="monospace">(pardelay </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">)</span> returns an object called a
<i>parallel promise</i> which at some point in the future can be asked (by
the <span class="monospace">parforce</span> procedure) to complete the evaluation of &lt;expression&gt;, and deliver
the resulting value. The effect of &lt;expression&gt; returning
multiple values is unspecified.  (Racket <span class="monospace">future</span> is a procedure taking a thunk)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(par-delay-force </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">)</span>  [syntax]</p>
      <p>Semantics: The expression <span class="monospace">(par-delay-force </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">)</span> is
conceptually similar to <span class="monospace">(pardelay (parforce </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">))</span>, with
the difference that forcing the result of <span class="monospace">par-delay-force</span> will
in effect result in a tail call to <span class="monospace">(parforce </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">)</span>, while
forcing the result of <span class="monospace">(pardelay (parforce </span>&lt;expression&gt;<span class="monospace">))</span> might
not. Thus iterative lazy algorithms that might result in a
long series of chains of <span class="monospace">delay</span> and <span class="monospace">force</span> can be rewritten
using <span class="monospace">delay-force</span> to prevent consuming unbounded space
during evaluation.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(parforce </span><i>parpromise</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>The <span class="monospace">parforce</span> procedure forces the value of a promise created
by <span class="monospace">pardelay</span>, <span class="monospace">par-delay-force</span>, or <span class="monospace">make-par-promise</span>. If no value has
been computed for the promise, then a value is computed
and returned. The value of the promise must be cached
(or <i>memoized</i>) so that if it is forced a second time, the
previously computed value is returned. Consequently, a
delayed expression is evaluated using the parameter values
and exception handler of the call to <span class="monospace">parforce</span> which first requested
its value. If <i>parpromise</i> is not a parallel promise, it may be
returned unchanged.  (Racket <span class="monospace">touch</span>)</p><span class="monospace">(parforce (pardelay (+ 1 2))) =&gt; 3

(let ((p (pardelay (+ 1 2))))
  (list (parforce p) (parforce p))) =&gt; (3 3)

(define integers
  (letrec ((next
            (lambda (n)
              (pardelay (cons n (next (+ n 1)))))))
    (next 0)))

(define head

</span>
      <p>Various extensions to this semantics of <span class="monospace">delay</span>, <span class="monospace">force</span> and
<span class="monospace">delay-force</span> may be supported:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calling <span class="monospace">parforce</span> on an object that is not a parallel promise may simply return the object.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>It may be the case that there is no means by which a parallel promise can be operationally distinguished from its forced value. That is, expressions like the following may evaluate to either <span class="monospace">#t</span> or to <span class="monospace">#f</span>, depending on the implementation:</li></ul><span class="monospace">(eqv? (pardelay 1) 1) =&gt; unspecified
(pair? (pardelay (cons 1 2))) =&gt; unspecified
</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementations may implement <i>implicit forcing</i>, where the value of a parallel promise is forced by procedures that operate only on arguments of a certain type, like <span class="monospace">cdr</span> and <span class="monospace">*</span>. However, procedures that operate uniformly on their arguments, like <span class="monospace">list</span>, must not force them.</li></ul><span class="monospace">(+ (pardelay (* 3 7)) 13) =&gt; unspecified

(car (list (pardelay (* 3 7)) 13)) =&gt; unspecified
</span>
      <p><span class="monospace">(parpromise? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if its argument is a
parallel promise, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise. Note that parallel promises are not
necessarily disjoint from other Scheme types such as procedures.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-par-promise </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a parallel promise which,
when forced, will return <i>obj</i> . It is similar to <span class="monospace">pardelay</span>, but
does not delay its argument: it is a procedure rather than
syntax. If <i>obj</i> is already a promise, it is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(current-parpromise)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the parallel promise whose execution is the current continuation. If a parallel promise itself uses <span class="monospace">parforce</span>, parallel-promise executions can be nested, in which case the descriptor of the most immediately executing parallel promise is returned. If the current continuation is not a parallel promise execution, the result is <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>
      <p>Parallel implementation of this proposal is necessarily very system-dependent.  However, it is correct to implement
<span class="monospace">pardelay</span>, <span class="monospace">par-delay-force</span>, <span class="monospace">parforce</span>, <span class="monospace">parpromise?</span>, <span class="monospace">make-par-promise</span>, and <span class="monospace">current-parpromise</span> as
<span class="monospace">delay</span>, <span class="monospace">delay-force</span>, <span class="monospace">force</span>, <span class="monospace">promise?</span>, <span class="monospace">make-promise</span>, and <span class="monospace">(lambda () #f)</span> respectively.</p></div></body></html>
