    <pre>= {{{NaNs}}} library proposal = 

== Library proposal == 
       
`(nan)`

Returns a {{{NaN}}}  with an  implementation-defined chosen  payload.  Implementations are free to return different {{{NaNs}}} for each `nan` invocation or not. If so and as a matter of consistency, {{{NaN}}} representation such as &quot;+nan.0&quot; should also return different {{{NaNs}}}.

`(nan &lt;payload&gt;)`

Returns a {{{NaN}}} with the given payload as its content.  Valid values for `&lt;payload&gt;` are implementation-dependent.

`(nan? &lt;obj&gt;)`

Returns `#t` if `&lt;obj&gt;` is a {{{NaN}}}. 

`(nan-signaling? &lt;obj&gt;)`

Returns `#t` if `&lt;obj&gt;` is a signaling {{{NaN}}}.

`(nan-payload &lt;obj&gt;)`

Returns the payload content of `&lt;obj&gt;` if it is a {{{NaN}}}.

`(nan-negative? &lt;obj&gt;)`

Returns the sign part of `&lt;obj&gt;` if it is a {{{NaN}}}.


== Rationale ==

This library is about {{{NaNs}}} operation handling.

For IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) implementation there is one {{{NaN}}} concept but many different {{{NaNs}}}. From the purpose of {{{NaNs}}}, we have to be able to distinguish between {{{NaNs}}}. For that effect, {{{NaNs}}} carry a ''payload'' intended to put diagnosis information about what caused a {{{NaN}}} to be produced.


=== Purposes of {{{NaNs}}} ===

  * allowing computation to continue even in the presence of incorrect computation, instead of aborting with an error.
 
  * to be able to discover what kind of error has been encountered if needed, by propagating a {{{NaN}}} value.


When the reader reads &quot;+nan.0&quot;, it has to choose one particular internal representation for it.  It is free to choose one representation shared for all &quot;+nan.0&quot; or to choose a different one each time it encounters another &quot;nan.0&quot;. This is what the following means:

{{{
  (eqv? +nan.0 +nan.0) =&gt; unspecified
}}}

However the identity of a particular {{{NaN}}} should not be questioned. I mean I think we should have this:

{{{
  (let ((a +nan.0)) (eqv? a a)) =&gt; #t
}}}

The following is a desirable behaviour, but I would not push for it into the standard:

{{{
  (let ((a (/ 0.0 0.0)) (b (sin +inf.0))) (eqv? a b)) =&gt; #f 
}}}
  
== Use cases examples ==

 * Report invalid sensor values

Instead of returning strange values such as 99999 which could be mistaken for real ones and cause dramatic effects, sensors may use {{{NaNs}}} to report invalid values.  A payload may be added to report an additional message.

 * Mark undefined values in a vector of reals

In order to identify wrong usage of uninitialased vectors, one could fill vectors with {{{NaNs}}} containing indexes in their payloads.

{{{
(define (make-reals-vector N)
  (if (&gt;= N 0)
    (let ((result (make-vector N)))
      (let loop ((i 0))
        (if (&lt; i N)
            (begin 
              (vector-set! result i (nan i))
              (loop (+ i 1)))
            result )))
    (error &quot;make-float-vector: negative argument&quot;)))
}}}    


== Comments by John Cowan ==

WG1 still hasn't decided what the behavior of `eqv?` should be when dealing with NaNs.  In both draft 6 and the current head, it is unspecified.  Therefore it makes sense to me to introduce a new `nan=?` predicate for seeing if two !NaNs have the same payload.
