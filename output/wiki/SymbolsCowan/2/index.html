      <p>This WG2 proposal extends Scheme symbols in a variety of traditional Lisp ways: it provides uninterned symbols, symbol values, and property lists.  It can be implemented portably on top of standard Scheme symbols, provided that the <span class="monospace">symbol?</span>, <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span>, and <span class="monospace">symbol-&gt;string</span> procedures are redefined to deal with uninterned symbols as well as standard symbols.  For a high-quality implementation, a record facility is needed for uninterned symbols, and a hash table or similar lookup table to associate standard symbols with their values and property lists.</p>
      <h2 id="Uninternedsymbols">Uninterned symbols</h2>
      <p>Uninterned symbols are like standard symbols, except that they have two names, a unique name and a human-readable name (which need not be unique).  Implementations need not guarantee that the unique name is truly unique, but should make a best effort to do so, such as by using a large pseudo-random string of characters as the name.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is either a standard symbol or an uninterned symbol, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(standard-symbol? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a standard symbol, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(uninterned-symbol? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is an uninterned symbol, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol=? </span><i>symbol1 symbol2</i> ... <span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if all the <i>symbol</i>s have the same unique name in the sense of <span class="monospace">string=?</span>, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> otherwise.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-&gt;string </span><i>symbol</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the name of <i>symbol</i> as a string if it is a standard symbol, or its human-readable name if it is an uninterned symbol.  It is an error to mutate this string.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(string-&gt;symbol </span><i>string</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the standard symbol whose name is <i>string</i>.  (Same as the standard version of this procedure.)</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(string-&gt;uninterned-symbol </span><i>string</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated uninterned symbol whose human-readable name is <i>string</i>, and whose unique name is chosen by the implementation.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-unique-name </span><i>symbol</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Return the name of <i>symbol</i> if it is a standard symbol, or its unique name if it is an uninterned symbol.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(gensym </span> [ <i>string</i> ] <span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated uninterned symbol whose human-readable name is distinct from that of any symbol returned by a previous call to <span class="monospace">gensym</span>.  If <i>string</i> is present, it is used as a prefix of the human-readable name.</p>
      <h2 id="Symbolvalues">Symbol values</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-ref </span><i>symbol</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns an object which is the value of <i>symbol</i>.  The value may or may not have anything to do with the global binding of the identifier corresponding to <i>symbol</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-set! </span><i>symbol obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Changes the value of <i>symbol</i> to <i>obj</i>.  This may or may not affect the global binding of the identifier corresponding to <i>symbol</i>.  An unspecified value is returned.</p>
      <h2 id="Propertylists">Property lists</h2>
      <p>A property list (plist) is a list that can be bound to a symbol.  The original value of a symbol's plist is implementation-dependent.  The structure of a plist is a sequence of symbols known as <i>indicators</i>, some of which may be followed by an arbitrary object known as the indicator's <i>value</i>.  Note that plists are a list of objects, unlike alists which are a list of pairs.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(get-property </span><i>symbol indicator</i> [ <i>obj</i> ] <span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>If a symbol that is <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span> to <i>indicator</i> is found on the list, the next object on the plist of <i>symbol</i> is returned; it is an error if there is no next object.  If there is not, <i>obj</i> is returned if it is present, and if absent, <span class="monospace">#f</span> is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(get-property-list </span><i>symbol indicator</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>If a symbol that is <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span> to <i>indicator</i> is found on the plist of <i>symbol</i>, the rest of the plist is returned.  If there is not, <span class="monospace">#f</span> is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(set-property! </span><i>symbol indicator obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>If a symbol that is <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span> to <i>indicator</i> is found on the plist of <i>symbol</i>, the next object on the plist is destructively replaced with <i>obj</i>; it is an error if there is no next object.  If there is not, <i>indicator</i> and <i>obj</i> are consed on to the beginning of the plist.   An unspecified value is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(remove-property! </span><i>symbol indicator</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>If a symbol that is <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span> to <i>indicator</i> is found on the plist of <i>symbol</i>, the indicator and the next object on the list are destructively removed from the plist and <span class="monospace">#t</span> is returned; it is an error if there is no next object.  If there is not, nothing is done, and <span class="monospace">#f</span> is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-property-list </span><i>symbol</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the plist associated with <i>symbol</i> without copying it.  The caller is free to mutate the returned list.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-property-list-set! </span><i>symbol list</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>The plist associated with <i>symbol</i> is replaced with <i>list</i>, which is not copied.  An unspecified value is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-add-indicators! </span><i>symbol-list indicator</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><i>Symbol-list</i> is a list of symbols.  If a symbol that is <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span> to <i>indicator</i> is found on the plist of <i>symbol</i>, nothing is done.  If not, <i>indicator</i> is consed on to the beginning of the plist.  An unspecified value is returned.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-remove-indicators! </span><i>symbol-list indicator</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><i>Symbol-list</i> is a list of symbols.  If a symbol that is <span class="monospace">symbol=?</span> to <i>indicator</i> is found on the plist of <i>symbol</i>, the indicator is destructively removed from the plist.  If not, <i>indicator</i> is consed on to the beginning of the plist.  An unspecified value is returned.</p>
      <h2 id="Symbolutilities">Symbol utilities</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(symbol-append </span> <i>symbol</i> ... <span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a standard symbol whose name is the concatenation (as if by <span class="monospace">string-append</span>) of the names of the <i>symbol</i>s.  This may be used to construct pseudo-structured symbol names; for example, <span class="monospace">(symbol-append prefix &quot;:&quot; name)</span>.</p></div></body></html>
