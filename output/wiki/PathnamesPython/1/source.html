    <pre>== Path objects ==

Path objects represent filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.  This proposal is essentially a straight transliteration of the pure portion of the Python [http://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html `pathlib`] library into Scheme.  As a result, it does not provide any support for accessing the file system.  See also [http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0428 PEP 428].

Path objects are immutable objects of a disjoint type.  They are divided into two subtypes, Posix paths and Windows paths.  Most procedures in this proposal operate correctly on both subtypes.

Every path object has a ''drive'', a ''root'', and a possibly empty sequence of ''components'', all of which are strings.  The drive of a Posix path object is always the empty string; on Windows it can be a drive letter or device name followed by a colon, or a string of the form `//host/share` when the path object was created from an UNC pathname.  The root is the empty string for a relative path, `&quot;/&quot;` for an absolute path, or exceptionally `&quot;//&quot;` in path objects representing Posix pathnames beginning with `//` (whose meaning is system-dependent).
