      <h1 id="WG1RecordProposal">WG1 Record Proposal</h1>
      <p>By Aaron W. Hsu</p>
      <p>Current Revision: 7 June 2011</p>
      <h2 id="ExecutiveSummary">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>The following record proposal is designed to satisfy the following
constraints:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Respect for existing standards and practices</li>
        <li>Easy to implement and broadly useful</li>
        <li>Easy to extend and wrap</li>
        <li>Simple and Straightforward to use</li></ul>
      <p>It is designed as a counterpoint to SRFI-9 specifically to alleviate a 
transition from SRFI-9 and R6RS based code in a WG2 friendly manner 
without adding any controversial or unnecessary complexity. The design
emphasizes a respect for SRFI-9's feature-set while presenting the 
user and implementor with a more flexible and extensible interface 
for future extensions, such as implementation extensions or extensions
that may be defined by WG2.</p>
      <h2 id="BenefitscomparedtoSRFI-9">Benefits compared to SRFI-9</h2>
      <p>SRFI-9 is a well respected and well established de facto standard. 
With this understanding, this proposal tries to take this into account
while improving SRFI-9 in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eliminates filtering constructors in favor of other extensions 
    (not specified in this proposal). See the rationale for why this
    is a good thing.</li>
        <li>Provides an extensible syntax compatible with previous standards</li>
        <li>Does not intrude on implementation record systems</li></ul>
      <h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
      <p>Syntax: <span class="monospace">define-disjoint-type</span></p>
      <p>Auxiliary Keyword: <span class="monospace">fields</span><br>
Auxiliary Keyword: <span class="monospace">mutable</span><br>
Auxiliary Keyword: <span class="monospace">immutable</span></p>
      <p>The general syntax for <span class="monospace">define-disjoint-type</span> is as follows:</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(define-disjoint-type (name constructor predicate) clause ...)</span></p>
      <p>The <span class="monospace">clause</span> is one or more record clauses that define features and 
behaviors of the record. Only one is defined for this proposal, but
others may be provided by implementations:</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(fields field-spec ...)</span></p>
      <p>Only one <span class="monospace">fields</span> clause should appear in the list.
In a <span class="monospace">fields</span> clause the <span class="monospace">field-spec</span> has one of the following forms:</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(immutable field-name field-accessor)</span><br>
<span class="monospace">(mutable field-name field-accessor field-mutator)</span></p>
      <p>This has the following effect in the scope of the call 
to <span class="monospace">define-disjoint-type</span>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="monospace">name</span> is bound to an implementation specific value (may be syntax)</li>
        <li><span class="monospace">constructor</span> is bound to a procedure that takes as many arguments
    as there are <span class="monospace">field-name</span>s. Applying <span class="monospace">constructor</span> creates an instance
    of the record whose field values are those specified by the arguments
    to the <span class="monospace">constructor</span> in the same order as the <span class="monospace">field-names</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="monospace">predicate</span> is bound to a procedure of one argument that returns true
    only for objects returned by <span class="monospace">constructor</span>; implementations may of 
    course extend this behavior if there are other ways of creating
    instances of <span class="monospace">name</span> records. For all other values, <span class="monospace">predicate</span> returns
    false.</li>
        <li>Each <span class="monospace">field-accessor</span> is bound to a procedure of one argument, which
    when passed an instance of a <span class="monospace">name</span> record, will return the value of
    the slot associated with the accessor.</li>
        <li>Each <span class="monospace">field-mutator</span> is bound to a procedure of two arguments, which
    when passed an instance of a <span class="monospace">name</span> record and a value will mutate 
    the slot associated with <span class="monospace">field-mutator</span> to contain the value passed
    to <span class="monospace">field-mutator</span>.</li></ul>
      <h2 id="CompatibilitywithSRFI-9">Compatibility with SRFI-9</h2>
      <p>A trivial macro layered over <span class="monospace">define-disjoint-type</span> is sufficient to 
make/use SRFI-9 code:</p><span class="monospace">(define-syntax define-record-type
  (syntax-rules (%)
    [(_ % (name constructor predicate) (cargs ...) ((m fn rest ...) ...) ())
     (begin
       (define-disjoint-type (name %constructor predicate)
	 (fields (m fn rest ...) ...))
       (define constructor 
	 (let ()
	   (define-syntax in-field
	       (syntax-rules (fn ...)
	       [(_ fn) #t] ...
	       [(_ else) #f]))
	   (unless (in-field cargs) 
	     (error 'define-record-type &quot;no such field&quot; 'cargs))
	   ...
	   (lambda (cargs ...)
	     (define-syntax get-val
	       (syntax-rules (cargs ...)
		 [(_ cargs) cargs] ...
		 [(_ filtered) (if #f #f)]))
	     (%constructor (get-val fn) ...)))))]
    [(_ % bindings cargs (fcs ...) ((fn fa) rest ...))
     (define-record-type % bindings cargs 
       (fcs ... (immutable fn fa)) (rest ...))]
    [(_ % bindings cargs (fcs ...) ((fn fa fm) rest ...))
     (define-record-type % bindings cargs 
       (fcs ... (mutable fn fa fm)) (rest ...))]
    [(_ name (constructor cargs ...) predicate fields ...)
     (define-record-type % (name constructor predicate) 
       (cargs ...) () (fields ...))]))
</span>
      <p>See the rationale notes about the filtering constructor for more 
discussion about this.</p>
      <p>Additionally, if an implementation wishes to implement this records system
on top of their own (assuming that they have SRFI-9 already implemented), 
then the following macro is sufficient:</p><span class="monospace">(define-syntax define-disjoint-type
  (syntax-rules (fields)
    [(_ (name constructor predicate) (fields (m fn rest ...) ...))
     (define-record-type name (constructor fn ...) predicate
       (fn rest ...) ...)]))
</span>
      <p>The above assumes that a hygienic implementation of SRFI-9 is available.
Without a hygienic implementation of SRFI-9, the implementor must take 
care to deal with the cases where the field names are symbolically 
equal but not hygienically/lexically equivalent.</p>
      <h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
      <p><b>Dropping the filtering constructor.</b>
The most notable and indeed the most important divergence of this 
proposal from the core semantics of SRFI-9 is the elimination of 
the filtering constructor as defined in SRFI-9. This proposal 
does <b>not</b> preclude extensions which enable a more general 
functionality, such as R6RS protocols, and other implementation 
proposals, but it does eliminate a filtering constructor in the 
way that it is handled by SRFI-9, which is rife with subtle 
problems.</p>
      <p><i>Problem 1</i>. The filtering constructor provides no means of 
determining or specifying the default values of the record slots 
that are not passed values explicitly in the call to the constructor.
This requires that all record slots which are to be useful that 
do not have an explicit constructor field must be mutable, since 
the only way to fill the record slot with something useful after 
construction is to mutate the slot. This makes it impossible to 
have an immutable record slot that is not given an explicit value 
in the constructor using the filtering constructor mechanism. This 
is done very often (I use this often to embed things like hidden 
lookup tables into an object; these lookup tables will never change, 
and I can get important gains by enforcing immutability on these 
slots). Instead, if one wishes to achieve this sort of thing, 
one must avoid the use of the filtering constructor and use 
an explicit procedure that calls the constructor. This is a much 
more common case in SRFI-9 usage, and makes the filtering constructor 
much less useful.</p>
      <p>One may also argue that the filtering constructor so used suggests 
to the user a less functional style in programming, which is arguably 
less elegant, since other record systems achieve a more general 
result without requiring mutation.</p>
      <p><i>Problem 2</i>. The filtering constructor is also ill-defined by 
SRFI-9 as to whether or not field names are matched hygienically or 
symbolically. In the reference implementation they are matched 
symbolically, which breaks hygiene and makes the use of SRFI-9 
records inside of macros dangerous in combination with filtering 
constructors. The above implementation that I have provided for 
SRFI-9 does match field names hygienically, improving the security 
of the implementation, but this diverges from the reference implementation 
of SRFI-9. Both SRFI-9 and SRFI-99 share this symbolic equality 
matching limitation. I do not know whether existing implementations 
follow the reference implementation in this matter.</p>
      <p><i>Comparison</i>. The above problems are addressed by this proposal 
in two ways. Firstly, by removing the filtering constructor, no 
functionality has been lost, but issues with hygiene and mutability 
have been addressed. The above implementation of SRFI-9 in terms of 
this proposal demonstrate how the same functionality in SRFI-9 
filtering constructors may be achieved with relative ease. Moreover, 
by removing the filtering constructor, we have removed all situations 
where it will make a difference whether field names are matched 
hygienically or symbolically. Since the field-names are not used for 
anything except place-holders in the current proposal, this means that
this issue is effectively side-stepped, and more expansive record 
systems can deal with the issue explicitly. This reduces complexity 
of the specification for records in WG1 and makes the overall 
system simpler.</p>
      <p><b>Lack of inheritance.</b>
My initial proposal included a provision for single inheritance. This 
proposal did not receive enough consensus and lost to SRFI-9. I therefore
remove the single inheritance in favor of remaining closer and less 
divergent from SRFI-9.</p>
      <p><b>Divergence from SRFI-9 syntax.</b>
The syntax of this proposal is a very small subset of R6RS. This is a 
divergence from SRFI-9, but was chosen for particular reasons. Namely,
this syntax is much more forward compatible with possible extensions 
that may be defined by implementations (such as R6RS or WG2 implementations)
and it is compatible with existing R6RS record definitions. There is 
a lot of R6RS code out there.</p>
      <p>When choosing a syntax, either SRFI-9 or R6RS, there will be backwards
compatibility issues. Those users who use R6RS will be left out if 
one uses SRFI-9, and those who use R6RS might leave behind those who
use SRFI-9. Thus, neither syntax provides inherently better backwards 
compatibility than the other, since there exist many code repositories
with both, sometimes intermingled. The choice to go with the R6RS syntax
was made based on its cleanliness and overall elegance in comparison to
SRFI-9, not the least of which is the removal of the filtering 
constructor.</p>
      <p>In summary, the SRFI-9 syntax doesn't really gain us that much in 
backwards compatibility and makes our future compatibilities much more 
complex. Continuing with the SRFI-9 syntax is very likely to cause us
pain in the future and make useful progress more difficult. It is 
better to have a single syntax framework that enables us to move forward
on a single record syntax rather than encouraging implementations and 
working groups in the future, such as WG2, to diverge from the WG1
record system entirely.</p>
      <p><b>Using the name <span class="monospace">define-disjoint-type</span>.</b>
A major complaint to the R6RS record system was that it used the same 
name as the SRFI-9 system. In reference to this, I have chosen not to 
use the <span class="monospace">define-record-type</span> name so that it does not conflict with 
either the R6RS syntax or the SRFI-9 implementations. R6RS implementations
can support the new syntax by aliasing, while SRFI-9 implementations can 
continue providing SRFI-9 while also providing this syntax, with 
translations between the two being straightforward.</p>
      <p><b>Use of keywords for immutability of fields.</b>
The use of keywords for fields (whether or not explicitly bound) is 
in keeping with the R6RS and allows for extensions that improve the 
brevity of record specifications. These extensions, which are common 
in implementations, automatically construct the identifiers for 
accessor and mutators. The keywords provide disambiguation for these
situations.</p>
      <p><b>Lack of R6RS name &quot;construction&quot;.</b>
Many people feel that the construction of identifiers using other 
identifiers (something that is not possible in pure syntax-rules) is 
not a good thing. While I have no problem with it, and encourage this
extension as an implementation extension, possibly as part of WG2, 
I recognize that this is something that can be done later, and there 
is no need to introduce such a controversial feature into the WG1 
record system.</p>
      <p><b>Binding of <span class="monospace">name</span>.</b>
The binding of name is to ensure that a certain concept of record 
semantics common in most systems is available. Most more complete
record systems will bind the name, and it is important not to let
user's think that they may in fact bind <span class="monospace">name</span> to something else
with the same results. This ensures upwards compatibility with 
an extended record system provided by WG2.</p></div></body></html>
