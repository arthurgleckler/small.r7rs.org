      <h2 id="PatternMatching">Pattern Matching</h2>
      <p>This is a proposal for a WG2 pattern matching library.  The motivation of
this proposal is to provide a pattern-matching facility similar to that in
the ML family of languages [Harper 2008], as such a facility allows the
succinct expression of some algorithms in a language very similar to the
underlying mathematics of the problem set.</p>
      <p>The Pattern Matching package can be imported as <span class="monospace">(rnrs match)</span>, which
provides new versions of several forms from the <span class="monospace">(rnrs core)</span> library, and
one form from the <span class="monospace">(rnrs control)</span> library.  Renaming or prefixing can be
used to make the pattern-matching forms provided by <span class="monospace">(rnrs match)</span> available
without replacing forms from <span class="monospace">(rnrs core)</span> and <span class="monospace">(rnrs control)</span>.</p>
      <p>Pattern matching algorithms have been provided as an extension to standard
Scheme syntax by a number of existing implementations, including Bigloo
[Serrano 2010], Chicken Scheme [Chicken Team 2009], Racket [Flatt 2010] and
others.  Many of these implementations have been influenced by a widely used
platform independent pattern matching library by Andrew K. Wright [Wright
1994].  A more recent library by Alex Shinn [Shinn 2010] provides similar
functionality in a mostly R5RS-compliant implementation.</p>
      <p>A similar pattern matching language for macro definition is also provided by
the core <span class="monospace">syntax-case</span> form.</p>
      <p>In addition, very limited forms of non-pattern value matching are supported
by the argument syntax of the R6RS Scheme <span class="monospace">lambda</span>, <span class="monospace">case-lambda</span>, and
<span class="monospace">define</span> forms.  A limited pattern functionality is provided in Common Lisp
by the <span class="monospace">DESTRUCTURING-BIND</span> macro.</p>
      <p>Where the above sources for pattern matching come into conflict, this
proposal attempts to provide compatibility first with the RNRS <span class="monospace">syntax-case</span>
form, and secondly to the existing pattern matching implementations.</p>
      <h2 id="Matching">Matching</h2>
      <p>The forms in this library work by attempting to <i>match</i> a Scheme value of
arbitrary complexity against one or more patterns.  If such a match
succeeds, zero or more variable bindings are created for the scope of a
corresponding body expression or expressions.  Match failure generally
triggers attempted matching against another pattern specified in the same
form, and a <i>match error</i> is generated if none of the provided patterns
match the given value.</p>
      <h3 id="SimplePatterns">Simple Patterns</h3>
      <p>A pattern can be</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a boolean, number, string, character, or byte-vector literal, an empty
    vector literal, or the empty list</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	#\A
	42
	#()
	()
</span>
      <p>in this case, the value MUST match in the sense of <span class="monospace">equal?</span>, and no
    variable is bound by this match.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a quoted datum</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	'b
	(quote (a b (c d)))
</span>
      <p>in this case, the value MUST match in the sense of <span class="monospace">equal?</span>, and no
    variable is bound by this match</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the special symbol <span class="monospace">_</span></li></ul>
      <p>in this case, any value will match, and no variable is bound by this
    match.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>any other symbol</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	a
	matched-val
</span>
      <p>in this case, any value will match, and that symbol is bound to the
    matched value for the scope of the body expression or expressions of the
    pattern matching form used.</p>
      <h3 id="AggregatePatterns">Aggregate Patterns</h3>
      <p>Patterns can be aggregated into more complex patterns in a couple of ways.
When this is done, multiple constituent patterns (&quot;subpatterns&quot;) can be
required to match, and all symbols bound to a value by any matching
subpattern are bound for the scope of the body expression or expressions of
the pattern matching form used.</p>
      <p>It is a syntax violation for the same unquoted symbol to appear more than
once in a pattern, except for the special symbols <span class="monospace">_' and </span>...'.</p>
      <p>An aggregate pattern can be</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a proper list of N subpatterns</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	(a b c)
	(a '= b)
	(_ middle _)
	(a (b c) d)
</span>
      <p>in this case, any list value of the same length where each subpattern in
    the pattern list matches the corresponding element in the value list
    will match, and the bindings corresponding to each subpattern will be
    carried out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an improper list of one or more subpatterns</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	(a b . c)
	(a (b c) . d)
</span>
      <p>in this case, every subpattern but the last MUST match the corresponding
    element of the value list, and the last subpattern of the improper
    pattern list MUST match the corresponding element of the value list if
    the value list is improper and has the same length as the pattern list,
    or the (possibly empty) remainder of the value list otherwise, and the
    bindings corresponding to each subpattern will be carried out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a proper or improper list of one or more subpatterns with the literal
    <span class="monospace">...</span> symbol occurring once or more in any position except either the
    first position of any list, or the last position of an improper list.</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	(a ...)
	(a ... b c)
	(a (b c) ... d)
	(a b ... . d)
</span>
      <p>in this case, the pattern list is matched as in the above proper or
    improper list cases, except that the subpattern before the <span class="monospace">...</span> symbol
    can match zero or more instances of the pattern preceding the <span class="monospace">...</span>
    symbol.  Variables bound by a subpattern preceding a <span class="monospace">...</span> are bound to
    a (possibly empty) list of all values matched by the pattern as if by a
    <span class="monospace">map</span> of the <span class="monospace">match</span> operator for that subpattern over each individual
    value matched.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a vector of one or more subpatterns</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">        #(a b c)
        #(1 b 3)
        #((a b) (c d))
</span>
      <p>in this case, any vector value of the same length where each subpattern in
    the pattern vector matches the corresponding element in the value vector
    will match, and the bindings corresponding to each subpattern will be
    carried out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a vector of N subpatterns with the literal <span class="monospace">...</span> symbol in any position
    except the first</li></ul>
      <p>examples:</p><span class="monospace">	#(a ...)
	#(a b ... c)
	#(1 ... b)
	#((a b) ... (c d))
</span>
      <p>in this case, the pattern list is matched as in the above vector case,
    except that the subpattern before the <span class="monospace">...</span> symbol can match zero or
    more instances of the pattern preceding the <span class="monospace">...</span> symbol.  Variables
    bound by a pattern preceding a <span class="monospace">...</span> are bound to a (possibly empty)
    list of all values matched by the pattern as if by a <span class="monospace">map</span> of the
    <span class="monospace">match</span> operator over each individual value matched.</p>
      <h2 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
      <p>In all of the matching forms, if the input value cannot be matched against any
of the supplied patterns, an error MUST be signaled.</p>
      <h2 id="BasicForms">Basic Forms</h2>
      <p>The <span class="monospace">(rnrs match)</span> library exports the form</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(match ....)</span>	   	 	syntax</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">match</span> has the syntax</p><span class="monospace">	(match &lt;val&gt;
          (&lt;pat&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;body&gt; ...)
          (&lt;pat&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;body&gt; ...)
            ...)
</span>
      <p>and attempts to match the input value <i>&lt;val&gt;</i> against each specified
pattern <i>&lt;pat&gt;</i> in order.  For the first pattern which successfully
matches the input value, <span class="monospace">match</span> MUST evaluate the corresponding expressions
<i>&lt;body&gt;</i> in the scope of the bindings created by the successful match, and
MUST return the value of the last corresponding <i>&lt;body&gt;</i> expression,
which MUST be evaluated in tail context.</p>
      <p>Note that it is not required that each pattern <i>&lt;pat&gt;</i> be an aggregate
pattern, but the meaning of a simple pattern ought to be considered
carefully.  In particular, a pattern consisting of a single symbol will
always match, and bind the entire list of arguments to that symbol (this can
be used in a manner similar to the <span class="monospace">else</span> clause in a <span class="monospace">cond</span> form), while a
pattern consisting of the special symbol <span class="monospace">_</span> will always match without
binding.</p>
      <p>If no pattern <i>&lt;pat&gt;</i> successfully matches the input value <i>&lt;val&gt;</i>, an
error MUST be signaled.</p>
      <h2 id="DerivedForms">Derived Forms</h2>
      <p>For convenience, the following derived forms are also exported by the `(rnrs
match)<span class="monospace"> library.  They can be imported with a prefix such as </span>match-` so
that they will not collide with the Scheme core, or can be allowed to
override it to make pattern matching appear to be integral to Scheme.</p>

      <p>Each <i>&lt;expr&gt;</i> MUST be evaluated and then pattern matched against the
corresponding pattern <i>&lt;pat&gt;</i> in the current environment (in some
unspecified order). The expressions <i>&lt;body&gt;</i> MUST then be evaluated in an
environment containing all of the bindings resulting from each pattern

      <p>If any of the patterns <i>&lt;pat&gt;</i> fail to match the value of the

left-to-right order, and identifiers bound by matching each pattern

      <p>If any of the patterns <i>&lt;pat&gt;</i> fail to match the value of the

      <h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>
      <p>The following questions are not dealt with in this draft, but merit
consideration as part of the RNRS standardization process, or in future RNRS
revisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quasipattern forms, defined with quasiquotation syntax, as supported by
    several existing implementations.  These are most powerful when used
    with the splicing operator <span class="monospace">,@</span> to extend <span class="monospace">...</span> notation to a repeating
    sequence of more than one subpattern occuring directly within a list.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>boolean patterns defined with <span class="monospace">and</span>, <span class="monospace">or</span>, or <span class="monospace">not</span>, allowing more
    complex combinations of subpatterns in an aggregate pattern.  The <span class="monospace">or</span>
    form carries with it the possibility of binding a matching value to a
    given variable in some matches of the same pattern, but not others,
    while the <span class="monospace">not</span> form does not perform variable binding itself (but is
    often used within an <span class="monospace">and</span> form).</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Extending the provided pattern grammar to include constructors of RNRS
    syntactic or procedural record types, or enumeration types, either
    automatically at record or enumeration type definition time, or by
    manually specifying records to be eligible for such matching through
    some additional syntax.</li></ul>
      <p>Such support might allow, given an enumeration constructor <span class="monospace">e</span> and a
    record constructor <span class="monospace">make-r</span>, pattern matches on the form</p><span class="monospace">	((make-r w x y) (e z))
</span>
      <p>against a value of</p><span class="monospace">	(a b)
</span>
      <p>where <span class="monospace">a</span> is a record of the type constructed by <span class="monospace">r</span>, and <span class="monospace">b</span> is an
    enumeration of the type constructed by <span class="monospace">e</span>, resulting in the variables
    <span class="monospace">w</span>, <span class="monospace">x</span>, <span class="monospace">y</span>, and <span class="monospace">z</span> being bound for the scope of the match operator
    used.  Exceptions, as a special case of record types, could be similarly
    matched, and pattern-matching variants of <span class="monospace">with-exception-handler</span> and
    <span class="monospace">guard</span> might be provided.</p>
      <p>Such matching is not specified in this proposal, as it would require
    changes to the <span class="monospace">(rnrs records ...)</span> and <span class="monospace">(rnrs enums)</span> libraries.</p>
      <p>Typically, such interaction would extend to definining appropriate
    pattern-matching scaffolding when a new record or enumeration
    constructor is defined.   Such an interaction ought to be considered
    if this form of pattern matching is later aded to the core language.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allowing the specification of guard expressions in <span class="monospace">match</span> clauses which
    must evaluate to true for that clause to match.  This has proved a very
    useful feature in languages of the ML family [Ruegg 2009], but adds some
    complexity to the matching implementation.  If this is examined in
    future versions, a variant of the <i>fender</i> syntax of the RNRS
    <span class="monospace">syntax-case</span> library form or the <span class="monospace">=&gt;</span> failure continuation support of
    the Wright [Wright 1994] pattern matching library merit particular
    consideration.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Laying the groundwork for replacing the core version of <span class="monospace">lambda</span>, <span class="monospace">let</span>,
    <span class="monospace">let*</span>, and <span class="monospace">letrec</span> with the versions provided by the `(rnrs match
    core)` library in a future revision in the RNRS series</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Unifying the syntax used here with that of the core syntax-case form,
    which uses a very similar pattern matching language</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Vector-based treatment of <span class="monospace">...</span> matches within a vector aggregate
    pattern.  For consistency with existing implementations, the a pattern
    such as</li></ul><span class="monospace">	#(a ...)
</span>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>the variable <span class="monospace">a</span> to a <i>list</i> of zero or more matching values.  Once
can imagine cases where a <i>vector</i> of such matches would be useful,
but this may be harder to implement, and would differ from historical
practice.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
