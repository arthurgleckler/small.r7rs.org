      <p><i>I've replaced this proposal with a slightly amended version of <a href="/wiki/ImmutableParametersCowan">ImmutableParametersCowan</a>.</i></p>
      <h1 id="Parameters"><a href="/wiki/Parameters">Parameters</a></h1>
      <p>This proposal defines <i>parameter objects</i>, the procedure <span class="monospace">make-parameter</span> to create parameter objects, and the <span class="monospace">parameterize </span>special form to dynamically bind parameter objects. In the dynamic environment, each parameter object is bound to a cell containing the value of the parameter, which may be any Scheme object. When a procedure is invoked, the called procedure inherits the dynamic environment from the caller. The <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> special form allows the binding of a parameter object to be changed for the dynamic extent of its body.</p>
      <p>The proposal is an alternative to <a href="/wiki/ParametersSnellPym">ParametersSnellPym</a>, providing parameter objects that are <i>not</i> shared between threads.  It is a profile of SRFI 39, which does not specify how threads and parameters interact.</p>
      <h2 id="Rationale">Rationale</h2>
      <p>The <i>dynamic environment</i> is the structure which allows the system to find the value to be returned by the R5RS procedures <span class="monospace">current-input-port</span> and <span class="monospace">current-output-port</span>. The R5RS procedures <span class="monospace">with-input-from-file</span> and <span class="monospace">with-output-to-file</span> extend the dynamic environment to produce a new dynamic environment which is in effect for the dynamic extent of the call to the thunk passed as their last argument. These procedures are essentially special-purpose dynamic binding operations on hidden dynamic variables (one for <span class="monospace">current-input-port</span> and one for <span class="monospace">current-output-port</span>). The purpose of this proposal is to generalize this dynamic binding mechanism (which exists in all R5RS-compliant systems) to allow the user to introduce new dynamic variables and dynamically bind them.</p>
      <p>General dynamic binding mechanisms exist in several implementations of Scheme under various names, including fluid variables and parameter objects. The parameter objects specified in this proposal are compatible with the semantics of some, but not all, implementations of Scheme that currently support <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">SRFI-39</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="/wiki/Parameters">Parameters</a> are certainly useful:</p>
      <ol class="number">
        <li>They can be labor-savers, passing &quot;configuration information&quot; down through complex call stacks without needing explicit parameter passing through functions that do nothing with the parameter other than pass it to all child procedures called, until a lower layer actually uses it.</li></ol>
      <ol class="number" start="2">
        <li>They allow isolation of concerns; as per the previous point, the intermediate procedures do not need to know what configuration information is sent to which child procedures, which is useful when the child procedures are provided by external libraries, or are arbitrary closures which might invoke arbitrary external libraries.</li></ol>
      <ol class="number" start="3">
        <li>They allow dynamically scoped state, for tasks like exception handling and thread-local storage.</li></ol>
      <ol class="number" start="4">
        <li>They generalize a mechanism that must be present within the implementation to support <span class="monospace">current-input-port</span> and <span class="monospace">current-output-port</span>, making it portably available to library authors.</li></ol>
      <p><a href="/wiki/Parameters">Parameters</a> need to be specified as part of WG1 Scheme rather than implemented by portable libraries, because a portable library has no way of knowing if the implementation provides threads; and if it does, it has no portable way of implementing dynamically scoped state in a thread-safe manner.</p>
      <h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>
      <p>The dynamic environment is composed of two parts: the <i>local dynamic environment</i> and the <i>global dynamic environment</i>. The global dynamic environment is used to look up parameter objects that can't be found in the local dynamic environment. When parameter objects are created, their initial binding is put into the global dynamic environment by mutation. The local dynamic environment is only extended by the <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> form.</p>
      <p>Parameter objects are created with the <span class="monospace">make-parameter</span> procedure. The global dynamic environment is updated to cause the newly created parameter object to refer to a value, which can be retrieved by invoking the parameter object as a procedure with no arguments.</p>
      <p>A parameter object is a procedure which accesses the cell bound to a particular parameter object in the dynamic environment. When no argument is passed, the current contents of the cell is returned. When one argument is passed, the contents of the cell is updated with the result of applying the parameter object's conversion procedure to the argument.</p>
      <p>The <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> special form, when given parameter objects and corresponding values, binds, for the dynamic extent of its body only, each parameter object to a new value. The <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> special form behaves analogously to <span class="monospace">let</span> when binding more than one parameter object; that is, the order of evaluation is unspecified and the new bindings are only visible in the dynamic extent of the <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> special form.  However, while <span class="monospace">let</span> requires the user to specify identifiers to be bound, the parameter objects bound by <span class="monospace">parameterize</span> can be specified using arbitrary Scheme expressions.</p>
      <p>This proposal also specifies that <span class="monospace">current-input-port</span> and <span class="monospace">current-output-port</span> are implemented as parameter objects created with <span class="monospace">make-parameter</span>.</p>

      <h2 id="Interactionwiththreads">Interaction with threads</h2>
      <p>SRFI 39 does not specify how parameter objects interact with threads.  <a href="/wiki/ParametersSnellPym">ParametersSnellPym</a> provides mutable parameters shared between threads, which threads may atomically mutate to share information.  I take the view that using parameter objects in this way is an improper and unnecessary conflation of two distinct facilities, dynamic variables and shared data.  Instead, some mechanism for exchanging data between threads, such as mailboxes, should be provided as a part of standardizing threads, probably in WG2.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this proposal specifies that when a parent thread creates a new child thread, the cells inside the parameter objects in the child thread are new objects whose <i>initial</i> contents are the same  (in the sense of <span class="monospace">eqv?</span>) as their <i>current</i> (not initial) values in the parent thread.  In this way, parameters in the child thread are initialized sensibly but operate independently of the parent thread.</p>
