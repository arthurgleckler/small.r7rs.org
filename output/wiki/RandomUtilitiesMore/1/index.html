      <p>This is an unformatted dump of things that Mikael More thinks R7RS-large should provide somehow, from #scheme:</p>
      <h2 id="Utilities">Utilities</h2>
      <p>Also some kind of general purpose routines for strings, chars   (there are some fundamental things here that are clearly not in SRFI 13 and 14, like, <span class="monospace">string-strip</span>, <span class="monospace">string-replace-char</span>, |join|, a <span class="monospace">string-append</span> form that takes non-string arguments too a bit like <span class="monospace">print</span>, <span class="monospace">string&lt;-&gt;object</span> serialization), lists (same here - <span class="monospace">list-add!</span>, <span class="monospace">list-rm!</span>, <span class="monospace">filter!</span>).</p>
      <p>u8vector/blob (same here - <span class="monospace">u8vector&lt;-&gt;string</span> and file) tree structures like WT tree, mailboxes,  exception handling that also catches the continuation for stack trace printouts and other handling, queues... <span class="monospace">let-vector</span>,  <span class="monospace">number&lt;-&gt;string</span> with formatting parameters.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">let-args</span> is essentially <span class="monospace">(define-macro (let-args var def . code) </span>(apply (lambda ,def . ,code) ,var))`.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">map-w-index</span> and <span class="monospace">for-each-w-index</span> add a first argument to the called lambda, which is the zero-based index  of the element you are at.</p>
      <h2 id="Customports">Custom ports</h2>
      <p>Scheme brings an ports/IO API with open-file, call-with-input-file , open-tcp-client etc. where the Scheme environment exports this functionality to the program this is great. it can include char encoding for instance. and object serialization of course.</p>
      <p>I've gotten into uses like HTTPS and GZIP and HTTP and really any protocol out there.</p>
      <p>My firm conclusion is that the absolutely finest, and possibly only really reliable way to implement these in Scheme (apart from as block procedures that take or deliver an u8vector/blob) is that they need to export <i>Scheme ports</i>.</p>
      <ol class="alpha-lower" start="5">
        <li>g., <span class="monospace">(open-ssl-channel (open-tcp-client args))</span> =&gt; <i>ssl-channel-port</i>.</li></ol>
      <p>The only major detail to be added to this is that there's a certain need of mixing binary and character data, as is done in HTTP for instance.</p>
      <p>I got into this need for &quot;application layer&quot; port implementations  that have specific exports more or less at per-IO primitive level, from trying to implement an SSL channel atop bidirectional u8vector port.</p>
      <p>That failed miserably as the SSL logics code would not be up to date about whether there was EOF or not etc.</p>
      <p>This might be too implementation specific for any standard to touch it, i'm very well aware of this.</p>
      <p>Though, ability to abstract protocols and IO is at the core of delivering practical things, which is the subject of the larger language as I got it.</p></div></body></html>
