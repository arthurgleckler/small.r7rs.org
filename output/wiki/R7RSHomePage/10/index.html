      <p>This is the home page for R7RS, the Revised‚Å∑ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.  This version of Scheme has been divided into a small language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users of embedded languages; and a large language focused on the practical needs of mainstream software development.</p>
      <p>The report on the small language was finalized on July 6, 2013.  It is available <a href="/attachment/r7rs.pdf">in PDF format</a> and as <a href="/attachment/r7rs-small-spec.zip">LaTeX source code</a>.  There are <a href="/wiki/R7RSSmallErrata">errata</a>.</p>
      <p>A concise definition of the first partial edition of R7RS-large, known as the <a href="/wiki/RedEdition">Red Edition</a>, is now available.  It is a frozen copy of the Red Edition ballot plus the names of the libraries, which were passed by unanimous consent.  The results, which are now final, can be seen at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/wg2-red-results">http://tinyurl.com/wg2-red-results</a>.  A single physical document is in preparation.</p>
      <p>For R7RS-small implementations, see <a href="/wiki/ImplementationSupport">ImplementationSupport</a>.  <a href="http://larcenists.org">Larceny</a> includes all the SRFIs of the Red Edition, though they are not yet available under their standardized names.  Other implementations will hopefully follow.</p>
      <p>For R7RS benchmarks on many Schemes, see <a href="http://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/benchmark.html">this graphic</a>.  Some adjustments were made to accommodate the differences between Schemes.  The source is <a href="https://github.com/ecraven/r7rs-benchmarks">here</a>.</p></div></body></html>
