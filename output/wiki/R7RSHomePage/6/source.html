This is the home page for R7RS, the Revised‚Å∑ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.  This version of Scheme has been divided into a small language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users of embedded languages; and a large language focused on the practical needs of mainstream software development.

The report on the small language was finalized on July 6, 2013.  It is available [http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf in PDF format] and as [http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs-small-spec.zip LaTeX source code].  There are [wiki:R7RSSmallErrata errata].

For R7RS benchmarks on many Schemes, see [http://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/benchmark.html this graphic].  Some adjustments were made to accommodate the differences between Schemes.  The source is [https://github.com/ecraven/r7rs-benchmarks here].</pre>
