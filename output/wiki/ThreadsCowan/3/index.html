      <h2 id="Threads">Threads</h2>
      <p>This is a simple threads proposal based on SRFI-18, but eliminating <span class="monospace">thread-terminate!</span>, which has dodgy semantics: it does not give the thread any chance to recover.  Its Java equivalent, <span class="monospace">Thread.destroy()</span>, is deeply deprecated for the same reason.</p>
      <h2 id="Threadstates">Thread states</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A <i>running</i> thread is a thread that is currently executing. There can be more than one running thread on a multiprocessor machine.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A <i>runnable</i> thread is a thread that is ready to execute or running.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A thread is <i>blocked</i> if it is waiting for something to happen.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A <i>new</i> thread is a thread that has not yet become runnable. A new thread becomes runnable when it is started.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A <i>terminated</i> thread is a thread that can no longer become runnable (but <i>deadlocked</i> threads are not considered terminated).</li></ul>
      <p>The only valid transitions between the thread states are from new to runnable, between runnable and blocked, and from any state to terminated:</p><span class="monospace">                         unblock
       start            &lt;-------
  NEW -------&gt; RUNNABLE -------&gt; BLOCKED
    \             |      block  /
     \            v            /
      +-----&gt; TERMINATED &lt;----+
</span>
      <h2 id="Fairness">Fairness</h2>
      <p>In various situations the scheduler must select one thread to run or to unblock from a set of threads . The constraints on the selection process determine the scheduler's <i>fairness</i>. Typically the selection depends on the order in which threads become runnable or blocked and on some &quot;priority&quot; attached to the threads.</p>
      <p>Because we do not wish to preclude extensions to this package that require specific fairness constraints, there are no fairness constraints imposed. Implementations SHOULD document the fairness constraints they provide.</p>
      <h2 id="Memorycoherency">Memory coherency</h2>
      <p>Read and write operations on the store (such as reading and writing a variable, an element of a vector or a string) are not required to be atomic. It is an error for a thread to write a location in the store while some other thread reads or writes that same location. It is the responsibility of the application to avoid write/read and write/write races through appropriate uses of the synchronization primitives.</p>
      <p>Concurrent reads and writes to ports are allowed. It is the responsibility of the implementation to serialize accesses to a given port using the appropriate synchronization primitives.</p>
      <h2 id="Interactionswith`dynamic-wind`">Interactions with <span class="monospace">dynamic-wind</span></h2>
      <p>When the scheduler stops the execution of a running thread T1 (whether because it blocked, expired its quantum, was terminated, etc) and then resumes the execution of a thread T2, there is in a sense a transfer of control between T1's current continuation and the continuation of T2. This transfer of control by the scheduler does not cause any <span class="monospace">dynamic-wind</span> before and after thunks to be called. It is only when a thread itself transfers control to a continuation that dynamic-wind before and after thunks are called.</p>
      <h2 id="Theprimordialthread">The primordial thread</h2>
      <p>The execution of a program is initially under the control of a single thread known as the <i>primordial thread</i>. The primordial thread has an unspecified name, specific field, dynamic environment, dynamic-wind stack, and exception handler. All threads are terminated when the primordial thread terminates (normally or not).</p>
      <h2 id="Threadprocedures">Thread procedures</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(current-thread)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the current thread.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread? </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns <span class="monospace">#t</span> if <i>obj</i> is a thread, otherwise returns <span class="monospace">#f</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-thread </span><i>thunk</i><span class="monospace"> </span>[<i>name</i>]<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Constructs and returns a new thread.  <i>Thunk</i> is a procedure returning one value; <i>name</i> can be any Scheme object.</p>
      <p>A thread has the following fields: <i>name</i>, <i>specific</i>, <i>end-result</i>, <i>end-condition</i>, and <i>resource-list</i>, a list of communication resources it owns.   The first four fields can contain any Scheme object, and default to an unspecified value.  The <i>name</i> field is set from the optional <i>name</i> argument: it is an arbitrary Scheme object which identifies the thread (useful for debugging).</p>
      <p>This thread is not automatically made runnable (the procedure <span class="monospace">thread-start!</span> must be used to start it).  A thread's execution consists of a call to <i>thunk</i> with a continuation that causes the thread to store the value of <i>thunk</i> in its <i>end-result</i> field, abandon all resources in <i>resource-list</i>, and finally terminate. The dynamic-wind stack of the initial continuation is empty.</p>
      <p>The thread inherits the dynamic environment from the current thread, except that the exception handler is bound to a procedure which causes the thread to store in its <i>end-condition</i> field a FIXME object, abandon all resources in <i>resource-list</i>, and finally terminate.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-name </span><i>thread</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the content of the <i>name</i> field  of <i>thread</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-specific </span><i>thread</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns the content of the <i>specific</i> field of <i>thread</i>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-specific-set! </span><i>thread</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>obj</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Sets <i>specific</i> field of <i>thread</i> to <i>obj</i>.  Returns unspecified values.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-start! </span><i>thread</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Makes <i>thread</i> (which must be a new thread) runnable.  Returns <i>thread</i>.  Thread creation and thread activation are separated in order to avoid the race condition that would occur if the created thread tries to examine a data structure in which the current thread stores the created thread.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-yield!)</span></p>
      <p>The current thread exits the running state as if its quantum had expired. Returns unspecified values.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-sleep! </span><i>timeout</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>The current thread waits until the value of <span class="monospace">(elapsed-time)</span> is greater than or equal to <i>timeout</i>. This blocks the thread only if <i>timeout</i> represents a point in the future.  Returns unspecified values.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(thread-join! </span><i>thread</i> [<i>timeout</i> [<i>timeout-result</i>]]<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>The current thread waits until <i>thread</i> terminates (normally or not) or until the timeout is reached if <i>timeout</i> is supplied. If <i>timeout</i> is reached, returns <i>timeout-result</i> if it is supplied, otherwise a FIXME exception is raised. If <i>thread</i> terminated normally, the content of its <i>end-result</i> field is returned, otherwise the content of the <i>end-condition</i> field is raised.</p></div></body></html>
