    <pre>== Generalized `equal?` predicate ==

`(generalized-equal? `''obj1 obj2''` . `''comparator-list''`)`

Compares ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' for equality in the sense of the comparators provided in `comparator-list`.  A ''comparator'' is a procedure that is given two arguments to compare.  It returns `#t` if its arguments are to be considered equal, `#f` if they are to be considered unequal, and the symbol `pass` if it cannot decide.  It is an error for a comparator to return anything else.  The third argument passed to a comparator is ''comparator-list'', to be used in recursive calls to `generalized-equal?`.

The following algorithm is used to determine generalized equality:

  First, if ''x'' and ''y'' are the same in the sense of `eqv?`, the result is `#t`.  This keeps `generalized-equal?` consistent with `eqv?`, as `equal?` is.

  Next, each element of ''comparator-list''  is invoked on ''obj1'' and ''obj2'', passing ''comparator-list'' as its third argument.  If the comparator returns `#t` or `#f`, that is the result.

  If all comparators in ''comparator-list'' have been invoked with a `pass` result, then `generalized-equal?` behaves as if it had been invoked on the comparators `list-comparator`, `string-comparator`, `vector-comparator`, and `bytevector-comparator` defined below, plus additional implementation-defined comparators, if any.  If all of these return `pass`, then `generalized-equal?` returns `#f`, as `eqv?` would.

When `generalized-equal?` is invoked with an empty comparator list, it returns what `equal?` returns, except possibly on implementation-defined object types that are not record types, and for the fact that `generalized-equal?` is not required to return when handed circular data structures.  When it is invoked with `numeric-comparator`, `char-ci-comparator`, `string-ci-comparator`, and a comparator that descends into hash tables, it returns what Common Lisp's `equalp` returns.

`(make-atomic-comparator `''type-predicate compare-predicate''`)`

Returns a comparator that invokes ''type-predicate'' on its first and its second arguments.  If they both return `#t`, then they are assumed to be of the same type, and ''compare-predicate'' is invoked on the first and second arguments together.  If the result is `#t` or `#f`, then the comparator returns `#t` or `#f` respectively.  If they are not of the same type, a third value is returned.  The resulting comparator always ignores its third argument.

`(make-specific-equality . `''comparator-list''`)`

Return a curried version of `generalized-equal?` that accepts two arguments to be compared using the comparators in ''comparator-list''.

== Standard comparators ==

`(numeric-comparator `''obj1 obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are numbers that are equal in the sense of `=`, `#f` if they are numbers that are not equal in the sense of `=`, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

`(char-ci-comparator `''obj1'' ''obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are characters that are equal in the sense of `char-ci=?`, `#f` if they are characters that are not equal in the sense of `char-ci=?`, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

`(list-comparator `''obj1 obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are lists of the same length whose elements are equal in the sense of `generalized-equal?` when passed ''comparators-list'', `#f` if they are lists that are not equal in that sense, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

`(string-comparator `''obj1 obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are strings that are equal in the sense of `string=?`, `#f` if they are strings that are not equal in the sense of `string=?`, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

`(string-ci-comparator `''obj1 obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are strings that are equal in the sense of `string-ci=?`, `#f` if they are strings that are not equal in the sense of `string-ci=?`, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

`(vector-comparator `''obj1 obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are vectors of the same length whose elements are equal in the sense of `generalized-equal?` when passed ''comparators-list'', `#f` if they are vectors that are not equal in that sense, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

`(bytevector-comparator `''obj1 obj2 comparators-list''`)`

A comparator that returns `#t` if ''obj1'' and ''obj2'' are bytevectors of the same length whose elements are equal in the sense of `generalized-equal?` when passed ''comparators-list'', `#f` if they are bytevectors that are not equal in that sense, and `pass` otherwise.  The ''comparators-list'' argument is ignored.

When used by an implementation that doesn't provide bytevectors, this procedure always returns `pass`.
