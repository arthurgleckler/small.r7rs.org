      <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Chez Scheme represents an example of a high-speed incremental compiler with an interactive environemnt that follows a traditional lisp REPL behavior. It is interesting to note that Chez Scheme achieves high performance while still providing a dynamic environment, though the optimizations that Chez Scheme can make are limited by the top level semantics.</p>
      <h2 id="OfficialDocumentation">Official Documentation</h2>
      <p>The Chez Scheme User's Guide Version 8 provides a chapter on the <a href="http://www.scheme.com/csug8/use.html#./use:h3">Interaction Environment</a> of Chez Scheme. The reader is referred to this reading for the full description.</p>
      <h2 id="ImportantKeyREPLSemantics">Important Key REPL Semantics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expressions are entered at the REPL one at a time</li>
        <li>Each expression received is expanded and evaluated in the current interaction environment before the next expression that is entered is processed</li>
        <li>Files that are <span class="monospace">load</span>ed by reading each form in the file and processing each in turn, as if they had been entered by hand into the REPL</li>
        <li>There is a single interaction environment containing bindings to macro transformers and procedures</li>
        <li>The initial environment is the Chez Scheme default environment</li>
        <li>All initial bindings are immutable</li>
        <li>Definitions are mutable</li>
        <li>Initial bindings may be redefined</li>
        <li>A parameter exists that allows you to alter the interaction environment using <span class="monospace">environment</span> controls</li>
        <li>All identifiers are considered implicitly bound if not already defined
          <ul>
            <li>This allows recursive definitions to be entered one at a time</li>
            <li>As a result, top-level identifiers will mess with <span class="monospace">free-identifier=?</span>, requiring auxilary syntaxes to be explicitly bound instead of implicitly used</li></ul></li>
        <li>Top level identifiers are not optimized away, since they may be reassigned</li></ul></div></body></html>
