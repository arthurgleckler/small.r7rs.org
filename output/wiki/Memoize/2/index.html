      <p>This isn't a proposal, just some ideas and discussion points.</p>
      <p>The basic interface to memoizing is a variant of <span class="monospace">lambda</span>, perhaps called <span class="monospace">lambda/memo</span> as in Racket, or perhaps something else.  It returns a procedure that <i>memoizes</i> the results of calls on it in a <i>store</i>, and then pulls the results out of the store on later calls with the same arguments.  (Obviously, you don't want to do this if the procedure is impure.)</p>
      <p>It's easy to see how <span class="monospace">define/memo</span> would work as a more convenient version of this.</p>
      <p>There are a bunch of issues, though:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The most fundamental question is &quot;What counts as the 'same arguments'?&quot;  In Racket, <span class="monospace">lambda/memo</span> uses <span class="monospace">eq?</span> and <span class="monospace">lambda/memo*</span> uses <span class="monospace">equal</span>.  That doesn't seem very flexible.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the type of the store?  In Racket, hash tables based on <span class="monospace">eq?</span> and <span class="monospace">equal?</span> are available.  But in R7RS-large, there is no guarantee that an implementation that wants to support memoizing will also provide hash tables, so either we closely couple the two packages, or we provide a hook for constructing a store.  If the function accepts only a single argument which belongs to a small range of exact integers, a vector would be a <i>much</i> better store.</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>If arbitrary stores like a-lists are allowed, how are multiple arguments packaged up as a key for the store?</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>How do we specify the getter and setter for an arbitrary store?</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>How can we provide all this flexibility without compromising convenience for elementary uses?</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Should there be some way to let the function decide which return values to memoize?</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Do we support multiple returned values?  Maybe not by default, only if specifically requested, because of the overhead.</li></ul>
      <p>Adding extra arguments to <span class="monospace">lambda/memo</span> beyond the lambda-list and the body doesn't seem like a win to me (how do you know if the extra arguments are arguments, or part of the body?).  Are dynamic parameters the Right Thing here?  I don't think so, because all these factors should be bound to the static definition of the memoized functions.  Is this a place where we need keyword arguments (which can be implemented directly in R5RS with no new data structures or lambda magic)?</p>
      <p>I think we need a record type <span class="monospace">memoization-store</span> that provides a store constructor, comparator, getter, and setter.  But we still have the issue of associating an instance of <span class="monospace">memoization-store</span> with a particular lambda.</p></div></body></html>
