      <p>This is a list of voting dockets for WG2 work items (packages):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[WG2StandardDocket Standard Docket] -- items to be discussed and voted on individually.</li>
        <li>WG2ConsentDocket -- items that will pass using the given specifications unless there is an objection.</li>
        <li>WG2WG3Docket -- items that WG2 is not working on because it is asking the Steering Committee to assign them to future WGs.</li>
        <li>WG2RevoteDocket -- items that need to be revoted, either because the votes were equal for WG2 and WG3, or because they were forwarded from WG1.</li></ul></div></body></html>
