    <pre>This is a list of voting dockets for WG2 work items (packages):

 StandardDocket::
  Items to be discussed and voted on individually.

 ConsentDocket::
  Items that will pass using the given specifications unless there is an objection.

 ReassignedDocket::
  Items that WG2 is not working on because it is asking the Steering Committee to assign them to future WGs.

 RevoteDocket::
  Items that need to be voted on for acceptability, either because the number of votes were equal for WG2 and a future WG, or because they were forwarded from WG1, or because they were thought of after the most recent ballot.  The name of this docket is historical.</pre>
