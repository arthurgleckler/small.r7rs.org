      <p>I am a member of Working Group 1.</p>
      <p>My home page is here: http://speechcode.com/</p>
      <p>I love Scheme, and I write all my personal programming projects in
Scheme.  I'm sneaking Scheme in here and there in side projects at
work, too.</p>
      <p>Here's what I wrote to describe myself when I submitted my name to vote on R6RS:</p>
      <p>I've been an avid fan of Scheme since 1984, when I first used it as
  part of the 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
  course at MIT.  It has been my favorite programming language since
  then, and while I rarely use it at work, I use it for all my
  programming projects at home.  While I was an undergraduate, a staff
  member, and a graduate student at MIT, I spent many years working on
  MIT Scheme, including its interpreter, compiler, runtime system,
  debugger, and editor, and I continue to make small contributions in my
  spare time.  I've also spent a lot of time working on my own
  unfinished implementation of Scheme.  I followed the R4RS and R5RS
  standardization processes closely, participated some in the IEEE
  Scheme standardization process, and have participated quite a bit by
  email in the R6RS process.  I want to help make sure that R6RS
  maintains the right balance between the diamond-like jewel Scheme has
  always been and the practical everyday programming language that we
  have always wanted Scheme to be.</p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to making the Scheme standard even better in this
round.</p>
      <p>On <a href="/wiki/EditingTracPagesInEmacs">EditingTracPagesInEmacs</a>, I describe how to use trac-wiki.el
to view and edit pages on our Trac site directly from Emacs.</p>
