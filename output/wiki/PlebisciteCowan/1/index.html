      <p>Here's my proposal for the R7RS-small plebiscite.  The issue to vote on, per <a href="http://www.scheme-reports.org/2009/working-group-1-charter.html">the WG1 charter</a>, is: &quot;Does the eighth draft of R7RS-small satisfy the requirements of the charter?&quot;  I propose that the following ballot be sent to the scheme-reports mailing list and that replies (if formally sufficient) be interpreted as votes.</p>
      <h2 id="Ballot">Ballot</h2>
      <p>Full name (required):  Insert your name here.</p>
      <p>Location (optional):  Insert your physical location here.</p>
      <p>Affiliation (optional):  Insert your institutional affiliation, if any, here.</p>
      <p>Contact details (optional):  Insert any contact details here.  The email address from which you post the ballot will be assumed to be a primary contact method, unless overridden here.</p>
      <p>Statement of interest (required, unless you registered for the R6RS ratification or the 2009 Steering Committee election):  Insert at least 75 words of original content explaining your interest in Scheme and the Scheme standard and your stake in the outcome of the ratification process.</p>
      <p>Vote (required):  Insert &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; here.</p>
      <p>Rationale (optional):  Insert your explanation of why you voted the way you did here.  Anyone voting &quot;no&quot; is particularly encouraged to complete this section.</p>
      <h2 id="Comments">Comments</h2>
      <p>This is a variant of the registration and ballot forms used for R6RS ratification process and for the Steering Committee election.  Both registration and voting are combined into a single form.  Note that the entire content of the ballot will be published, since it is being sent to a public mailing list.</p>
      <h2 id="Issues">Issues</h2>
      <p>Should we worry about the fact that some people may not vote because their email addresses will be published?  I think not, but I may be out of date on this point.</p></div></body></html>
