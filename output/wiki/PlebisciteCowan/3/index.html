      <p>Here's my proposal for the R7RS-small plebiscite.  The issue to vote on, per <a href="http://www.scheme-reports.org/2009/working-group-1-charter.html">the WG1 charter</a>, is: &quot;Does the eighth draft of R7RS-small satisfy the requirements of the charter?&quot;  (Obviously this does not include the deadlines -- we've missed those.)</p>
      <p>I propose that the following ballot be sent to the scheme-reports mailing list with replies directed to the email address of a volunteer vote taker (I am attempting to find such a person by appealing on various non-Scheme-related mailing lists).  The vote taker would concatenate all received replies, minimally encoding &quot;@&quot; to &quot; at &quot;, and post the whole file to a publicly readable web page they control.</p>
      <p>If such a person cannot be found, posting to the scheme-reports@scheme-reports.org mailing list would probably be adequate.</p>
      <h2 id="Ballot">Ballot</h2>
      <p>Full name (required):  Insert your name here.</p>
      <p>Location (optional):  Insert your physical location here.</p>
      <p>Affiliation (optional):  Insert your institutional affiliation, if any, here.</p>
      <p>Contact details (optional):  Insert any contact details here.  The email address from which you post the ballot will be assumed to be a primary contact method, unless overridden here.</p>
      <p>Statement of interest (required unless you registered for the R6RS ratification or the 2009 Steering Committee election):  Insert at least 75 words of original content explaining your interest in Scheme and the Scheme standard and your stake in the outcome of the ratification process.</p>
      <p>Vote (required):  Insert &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; here.</p>
      <p>Rationale (optional):  Insert your explanation of why you voted the way you did here.  Anyone voting &quot;no&quot; is particularly encouraged to complete this section.</p>
      <h2 id="Comments">Comments</h2>
      <p>This is a variant of the registration and ballot forms used for R6RS ratification process and for the Steering Committee election.  Both registration and voting are combined into a single form.  Note that the entire content of the ballot will be published, since it is being sent to a public mailing list.</p>
      <h2 id="Issues">Issues</h2>
      <p>Some people might not vote because it would disclose their email address even with encoding protection.</p></div></body></html>
