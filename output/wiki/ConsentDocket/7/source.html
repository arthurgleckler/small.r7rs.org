    <pre>== WG2 Consent Docket ==

The following items will be approved without a formal vote unless someone objects, in which case they will be moved to another docket.  See [wiki:WG2Dockets WG2Dockets] for other dockets.

Note: &quot;Prefix stripping&quot; means that prefixes such as `fx`, `fl`, or `bitwise-` are removed from identifiers exported by this package.  That way, users can add back their own prefixes using the facilities of `import`.

Assertions: The R6RS procedure `assertion-violation` (same as R6RS `error`), with appropriate condition object support dependent on WG1 and WG2 decisions.

Bitwise: The R6RS `arithmetic bitwise` library with prefix stripping.

Explicit renaming macros: Uses the `er-macro-transformer` keyword (bare lambdas are unsupported).  Three arguments are provided to transformers: `form rename compare`.

Fixnum arithmetic: The R6RS `arithmetic fixnum` library with prefix stripping.

Format combinators: Alex Shinn's [http://synthcode.com/scheme/fmt/ fmt library], with prefix stripping and a touch of renaming.  The C formatting library is excluded.

Pretty-printer: see Format combinators

Getopt/args-fold:  SRFI 37.

Pattern matching: Andrew Wright's match library (Alex Shinn's [http://synthcode.com/scheme/match.scm reformulation])

Regex (S-exps and strings): Alex Shinn's [http://synthcode.com/scheme/irregex/ irregex library], with prefix stripping and a touch of renaming.  Specify full PCRE compatibility even though the irregex implementation doesn't support all of it.

SRFIs 1, 2, 13, 14, 31, 41, 43: Per those SRFIs, with possible prefix stripping (don't want to overdo it).  Some of these procedures may wind up in WG1 Scheme per CompleteSequenceCowan.

When/unless: Part of the R6RS `control` library.
