    <pre>== The numeric tower ==

This is an analysis of the R5RS provision that the full numeric tower may be subsetted.  Four boolean feature settings characterize different kinds of numeric towers: `exactness-preserving`, `ratios`, `inexact`, and `complex`.  These refer respectively to the closure of exact numbers under rational operations (except `/`), exact non-integer values, inexact rationals, and non-real numbers.

There are therefore 16 possible numeric towers.  Nine of them are known to have implementations, as shown below.  I write `+` if a feature is present and `-` if it is absent, and give a general description of the resulting tower and some Scheme implementations that provide it.

||`exactness-preserving`||`ratios`||`inexact`||`complex`||Description||Implementations
||-||-||-||-||A &quot;toy&quot; tower with bounded exact integers only (possibly appropriate where no numerical work will be done)||!SigScheme*||
||-||-||+||-||Fixnums and flonums (all arithmetic runs in essentially constant time)||Plain Chicken, Shoe*, !TinyScheme*, RScheme, BDC*, XLisp*, Schemik*, VX, SXM*, Inlab, Sixx, Sizzle (also Elisp*, C*)||
||-||-||+||+||Fixnums, flonums, and inexact complex numbers (all arithmetic runs in essentially constant time)||Stalin||
||-||+||+||+||Limited-range exact and inexact numbers||Scheme 7, Wraith||
||+||-||+||-||Exact integers and inexact real numbers (a good all-round compromise)||Bigloo, Scheme 9, Elk (also ISLisp)||
||+||-||+||+||Exact integers, inexact real numbers, and inexact complex numbers||SCM||
||+||+||-||-||Exact rational numbers only (reasonable for some purposes, but will often run very slowly without inexact support, so unsuitable for scientific-type work)||Dream, Oaklisp, Owl Lisp||
||+||+||+||-||Real numbers only||Psyche, Ikarus, Rep, Elk (also Clojure)||
||+||+||+||+||Full numeric tower||Racket, Gauche, MIT, Gambit, Chicken with the `numbers` egg, Scheme48/scsh, Kawa, SISC, Chibi, Guile, Chez, Vicare, Larceny, Ypsilon, Mosh, !IronScheme, STklos, KSi, UMB, Spark (also R6RS, Common Lisp, Pure)||

*These systems are technically exactness-preserving, but silently return the wrong answers when their arithmetic operations overflow.
