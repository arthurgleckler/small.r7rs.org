      <p><b>THIS IS NOT A PROPOSAL.  It's just a dumping ground for some stuff I don't want to lose track of.  There will be a proper proposal later.</b></p>
      <h2 id="Enumerationsets">Enumeration sets</h2>
      <p>Except as noted below, the procedures for creating and manipulating enumeration sets are the same as those for sets, except that <span class="monospace">set</span> is replaced by <span class="monospace">enum-set</span> in their names.  Wherever a newly allocated enumeration set is returned, it has the same enumeration type as the source sets.  It is an error to operate on enumeration sets of different types.</p>
      <p>This design is founded on <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-15.html">R6RS enumerations</a>, but with the addition of reified enumeration types along the lines suggested by <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/formal-comments/comment-262.txt">R6RS Formal Comment #262</a>.  The prefix <span class="monospace">enum</span> is used in all cases instead of using both <span class="monospace">enum</span> and <span class="monospace">enumeration</span> as R6RS does.</p>
      <p>The procedure <span class="monospace">enum-set-value</span> is just the identity function, so it is not provided.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-enum-type </span><i>symbol-list</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration type suitable for constructing enumeration sets whose members are the symbols in <i>symbol-list</i>.  These symbols are said to be <i>in the enumeration type</i>.  In R6RS the function of this procedure is provided as part of <span class="monospace">make-enumeration</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(enum-type-symbols </span><i>enum-type</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Return a newly allocated list of the symbols in <i>enum-type</i> in the original order.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(enum-type-index </span><i>enum-type symbol</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Return an exact integer corresponding to the position of <i>symbol</i> in the original list that created <i>enum-type</i>, or <span class="monospace">#f</span> if it was not one of those symbols.  The R6RS equivalent is the procedure returned by <span class="monospace">enum-type-indexer</span> when applied to an enum-set belonging to <span class="monospace">enum-type</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-enum-set </span><i>enum-type</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration set.  The possible elements of the set are the symbols in <i>enum-type</i>.  The set is empty.  The approximate R6RS equivalents are <span class="monospace">enum-set-constructor</span> and <span class="monospace">make-enumeration</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(make-universal-enum-set </span><i>enum-type</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration set.  The possible elements of the set are the symbols in <i>enum-type</i>.  The set contains all possible elements.  The approximate R6RS equivalent is <span class="monospace">enum-set-universe</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(enum-set </span><i>enum-type</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>element</i> ...<span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration set.  The possible elements of the set are the symbols in <i>enum-type</i>. The set is initialized to contain the <i>elements</i>.  There is no R6RS equivalent.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(list-&gt;enum-set </span><i>enum-type</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>list</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration set.  The possible elements of the set are the symbols in <i>enum-type</i>. The set is initialized to contain the elements of <i>list</i>.  There is no R6RS equivalent.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(enum-set-complement </span><i>enum-set</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration set that is the complement of <i>enum-set</i>.  This procedure is also in R6RS.</p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(enum-set-projection </span><i>enum-set</i><span class="monospace"> </span><i>enum-type</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>Returns a newly allocated enumeration set of type <i>enum-type</i>.  Its elements are the symbols belonging to <i>enum-set</i>, ignoring any symbols which are not in <i>enum-type</i>.  This procedure is also in R6RS, but uses a second enum-set in place of <i>enum-type</i>.</p></div></body></html>
