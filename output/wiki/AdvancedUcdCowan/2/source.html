It is an error to mutate any objects returned by these procedures.

== Blocks ==

''Blocks'' are disjoint objects that represent the allocation blocks into which the Unicode code point space is divided for administrative purposes.  Typically most of a block is allocated at once and contains characters from a single script, but there is often more than one block per script, some blocks contain characters from multiple scripts, and some characters in a block are allocated much later than the rest.  The list of blocks provided is implementation-dependent.  Since it is not possible to create new ones, `eqv?` may be used to compare them.

`(blocks)`

Returns a list of all blocks known to the implementation.

`(block-name `''block''`)`

Returns a string naming ''block''.

`(block-first `''block''`)`

Returns an exact integer representing the first (smallest) code point in the block.

`(block-last `''block''`)`

Returns an exact integer representing the last (largest) code point in the block.

== Named Sequences ==

Named sequences are disjoint objects which represent a sequence of Unicode code points that has a name specified by the Unicode Standard.  Named sequences may be provisional in one version of the UCD and then non-provisional in later versions.  The list of named sequences provided is implementation-dependent.  Since it is not possible to create new ones, `eqv?` may be used to compare them.

`(named-sequences)`

Returns a list of all named sequence objects known to the implementation.

`(named-sequence-name `''named-sequence''`)`

Returns a string naming ''named-sequence''.

`(named-sequence-code-points `''named-sequence''`)`

Returns a list of exact integers representing the code points of the ''named-sequence''.

`(named-sequence-provisional? `''named-sequence''`)`

Returns `#t` if the ''named-sequence'' is provisional, or `#f` if not.

== Normalization corrections ==

''Normalization-corrections'' are disjoint objects that represent official corrections to the UCD normalization tables.  The list of normalization-corrections provided is implementation-dependent.  Since it is not possible to create new ones, `eqv?` may be used to compare them.

`(normalization-corrections)`

Returns a list of all normalization-corrections known to the implementation.

`(normalization-correction-description `''block''`)`

Returns a string describing ''normalization-correction''.  Note that normalization-corrections don't have names.

`(normalization-correction-codepoint `''block''`)`

Returns an exact integer specifying the code point of the character whose normalization is being corrected.

`(normalization-correction-old `''block''`)`

Returns a list of exact integers specifying the normalization of `(normalization-correction-codepoint `''block''`)` before this normalization correction is applied.

`(normalization-correction-new `''normalization-correction''`)`

Returns a list of exact integers specifying the normalization of `(normalization-correction-codepoint `''block''`)` after this normalization correction is applied.

`(normalization-correction-version `''block''`)`

Returns a list of three exact integers specifying the version of the UCD (in the format of `ucd-version`) in which this normalization-correction was applied.

== Standardized variants ==

''Standardized-variants'' are disjoint objects that represent standardized variants of base charactesr.  The list of standardized-variants provided is implementation-dependent.  Since it is not possible to create new ones, `eqv?` may be used to compare them.

`(standardized-variants)`

Returns a list of all standardized-variants known to the implementation.

`(standardized-variants-description `''standardized-variant''`)`

Returns a string describing ''standardized-variant''.  Note that standardized-variants don't have names.

`(standardized-variants-when `''standardized-variant''`)`

Returns a string specifying the shaping environment under which ''standardized-variant'' is applied.

`(standardized-variant-base-codepoint `''block''`)`

Returns an exact integer specifying the code point of the base character of the standardized variant.

`(standardized-variant-variant-codepoint `''block''`)`

Returns an exact integer specifying the code point of the base character of the standardized variant.

== Undigested stuff from UAX #42 ==


=== CJK radicals ===

The cjk-radicals child of the ucd describes the CJK radicals. It has one child element cjk-radical per radical. The attributes on that last element capture the radical number, the corresponding CJK radical character, and the corresponding CJK unified ideograph.

[cjk radicals, 50] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element cjk-radicals {
      element cjk-radical { 
        attribute number { xsd:string {pattern=&quot;[0-9]{1,3}'?&quot;}},
        attribute radical { single-code-point },
        attribute ideograph { single-code-point }} + }?

=== Emoji sources ===

The emoji-sources child of the ucd describes the emoji sources.

[datatype for code points, 51] =  
  jis-code-point = xsd:string { pattern = &quot;[0-9A-F]{4}&quot; }

[emoji sources, 52] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element emoji-sources {
      element emoji-source {
        attribute unicode { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute docomo { jis-code-point? },
        attribute kddi { jis-code-point? },
        attribute softbank { jis-code-point? } } + }?</pre>
