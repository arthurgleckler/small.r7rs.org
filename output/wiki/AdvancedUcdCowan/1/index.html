      <p>Undigested stuff from UAX <a href="/ticket/42">#42</a>:</p>
      <p>5 Blocks</p>
      <p>The blocks child of the ucd describes the blocks. It has one child block element per block, with attributes to describe the extent and name of the block.</p>
      <p>[blocks, 46] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element blocks {
      element block { 
        attribute first-cp { single-code-point },
        attribute last-cp { single-code-point },
        attribute name { text }} + }?</p>
      <p>6 Named Sequences</p>
      <p>The named-sequences child of the ucd describes the named sequences. It has one child named-sequence element per named sequence, with attributes to describe the name and sequence.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the provisional-named-sequences child of the ucd describes the provisional named sequences.</p>
      <p>[named sequences, 47] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element named-sequences {
      element named-sequence { 
        attribute cps { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute name { text }} + }?</p>
      <p>ucd.content &amp;=
    element provisional-named-sequences {
      element named-sequence { 
        attribute cps { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute name { text }} + }?</p>
      <p>7 Normalization Corrections</p>
      <p>The normalization-corrections child of the ucd describes the normalization corrections. It has one child normalization-correction element per correction, with attributes to describe the code point affected, its old normalization, its new normalization and the version of Unicode in which the correction was made.</p>
      <p>[normalization corrections, 48] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element normalization-corrections {
      element normalization-correction { 
        attribute cp { single-code-point },
        attribute old { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute new { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute version { text }} + }?</p>
      <p>8 Standardized Variants</p>
      <p>The standardized-variants child of the ucd describes the standardized variant. It has one child element standardized-variant per variant. The attributes on that last element capture the variation sequence, the description of the desired appearance, and the shaping environment under which the appearance is different.</p>
      <p>[standardized variants, 49] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element standardized-variants {
      element standardized-variant { 
        attribute cps { two-code-points },
        attribute desc { text },
        attribute when { text }} + }?</p>
      <p>9 CJK Radicals</p>
      <p>The cjk-radicals child of the ucd describes the CJK radicals. It has one child element cjk-radical per radical. The attributes on that last element capture the radical number, the corresponding CJK radical character, and the corresponding CJK unified ideograph.</p>
      <p>[cjk radicals, 50] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element cjk-radicals {
      element cjk-radical { 
        attribute number { xsd:string {pattern=&quot;[0-9]{1,3}'?&quot;}},
        attribute radical { single-code-point },
        attribute ideograph { single-code-point }} + }?</p>
      <p>10 Emoji sources</p>
      <p>The emoji-sources child of the ucd describes the emoji sources.</p>
      <p>[datatype for code points, 51] =  
  jis-code-point = xsd:string { pattern = &quot;[0-9A-F]{4}&quot; }</p>
      <p>[emoji sources, 52] =  
  ucd.content &amp;=
    element emoji-sources {
      element emoji-source {
        attribute unicode { one-or-more-code-points },
        attribute docomo { jis-code-point? },
        attribute kddi { jis-code-point? },
        attribute softbank { jis-code-point? } } + }?</p></div></body></html>
