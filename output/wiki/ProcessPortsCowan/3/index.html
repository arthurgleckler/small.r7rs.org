      <h2 id="ProcessPorts">Process Ports</h2>
      <p>The procedures in this proposal start a new operating system process and return a binary port (remember, binary ports can do character I/O as well) connected to either the standard input (for an output port) or the standard output (for an input port) of the new process.  There is no support for input/output process ports, though an implementation could add them as an extension.</p>
      <p>This library depends on the acceptance of <a href="/wiki/SettingsListsCowan">SettingsListsCowan</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="Procedures">Procedures</h2>
      <p><span class="monospace">(open-input-process </span><i>filename</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p><span class="monospace">(open-output-process </span><i>filename</i><span class="monospace">)</span></p>
      <p>All of these are equivalent to the corresponding R5RS functions on file ports.  If <i>filename</i> is a string, it is a shell command suitable for passing to <span class="monospace">shell-command</span>.  If it is a list, it is a settings list as described in <a href="/wiki/PortsCowan">PortsCowan</a>.  Implementations MUST support the following keys:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><span class="monospace">path</span></dt>
        <dd>The system command to be executed.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">arguments</span></dt>
        <dd>A list of strings to be passed as the arguments of the command.  If absent or <span class="monospace">()</span>, no arguments are passed.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">environment</span></dt>
        <dd>An alist, mapping strings to strings, representing the environment variables to be passed to the new process and their values.  If the same environment variable appears more than once, all occurrences except the first are ignored, as is usual when processing alists.  If this key is absent, the current environment is passed.  If this key is <span class="monospace">()</span>, an empty environment is passed.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">stdin-redirection</span></dt>
        <dd>A string representing the file to open and pass to the new process as its standard input, or a port (it is an error if the port has no OS-level underpinnings).  If this key is absent, no redirection is done.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">stdout-redirection</span></dt>
        <dd>A string representing the file to open and pass to the new process as its standard output, or a port (it is an error if the port has no OS-level underpinnings).  If this key is absent, no redirection is done.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">stderr-redirection</span></dt>
        <dd>A string representing the file to open and pass to the new process as its standard error, or a port (it is an error if the port has no OS-level underpinnings).  If this key is absent, no redirection is done.</dd></dl></div></body></html>
