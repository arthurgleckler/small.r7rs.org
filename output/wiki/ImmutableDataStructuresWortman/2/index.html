      <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p>(TODO)</p>
      <h1 id="Efficiencybounds">Efficiency bounds</h1>
      <p>We specify required time efficiency upper bounds using big-O notation. We note when, in some cases, there is &quot;slack&quot; between the required bound and the theoretically optimal bound for an operation. Implementations may use data structures with amortized time bounds, but should document which bounds hold in only an amortized sense. The use of randomized data structures with expected time bounds is discouraged.</p>
      <h1 id="Deque">Deque</h1>
      <p>A deque (conventionally pronounced &quot;deck&quot;) is a queue data structure that supports efficient manipulation of either of its ends. It may be used in place of a (LIFO) stack or (FIFO) queue.</p>
      <p>The <i>unlabeled finger tree</i> data structure can meet all these requirements rather conveniently.</p>
      <h3 id="Construction">Construction</h3><span class="monospace">(ideque [element...])
</span>
      <p>Create a new deque containing <span class="monospace">element...</span>. The leftmost element (if any) will be at the front of the deque and the rightmost element (if any) will be at the back. Takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements.</p>
      <h3 id="Queries">Queries</h3><span class="monospace">(ideque? x)
(ideque-empty? deque)
(ideque-size deque)
</span>
      <p><span class="monospace">ideque?}}} and {{{ideque-empty?}}} take O(1) time; {{{ideque-size</span> may take O(n) time, though O(1) is optimal.</p>
      <h3 id="Queueoperations">Queue operations</h3><span class="monospace">(ideque-front deque)
(ideque-back deque)
</span>
      <p>Return the front/back element. It is an error for <span class="monospace">deque</span> to be empty. Each takes O(1) time.</p><span class="monospace">(ideque-push-front deque x)
(ideque-push-back deque x)
</span>
      <p>Return a new deque with <span class="monospace">x}}} pushed to the front/back of {{{deque</span>. Each takes O(1) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3><span class="monospace">(ideque-append deque...)
</span>
      <p>Return a new deque with the contents of the first argument deque followed by the others. Takes O(kn) time, where k is the number of deques and n is the number of elements involved, though O(k log n) is possible.</p>
      <h3 id="Conversion">Conversion</h3><span class="monospace">(list-&gt;ideque list)
(ideque-&gt;list deque)
</span>
      <p>Conversion between deque and list structures. FIFO order is preserved, so the front of a list corresponds to the front of a deque. Each operation takes O(n) time.</p>
      <h1 id="Set">Set</h1>
      <p>A sorted set data structure stores a finite collection of unique orderable (a.k.a. comparable or sortable) elements.</p>
      <p>These requirements can be satisfied by many flavors of <i>self-balancing binary trees.</i> Red-black trees, 1-2 brother trees, and labeled 2-3 finger trees are particularly convenient in an immutable context.</p>
      <h3 id="Orderpredicates">Order predicates</h3>
      <p>An <i>order predicate</i> for a set of orderable elements is a procedure <span class="monospace">precedes?}}} such that, for set elements {{{x}}} and {{{y</span>,</p><span class="monospace">(precedes? x y)
</span>
      <p>returns non-<span class="monospace">#false}}} iff {{{x}}} precedes {{{y}}} in the set's ordering. It returns {{{#false}}} when {{{x}}} succeeds (comes after) {{{y</span> or when the elements are tied for the same position.</p>
      <p>Note that <span class="monospace">&lt;}}}, {{{char&lt;?}}}, and {{{string&lt;?</span> are valid order predicates for sets of numbers, characters, and strings, respectively.</p>
      <p>It is essential that order predicates return <span class="monospace">#false</span> in the case of equal elements, as implementations may test for element equality with expressions of the form</p><span class="monospace">(and (not (precedes? x y))
     (not (precedes? y x)))
</span>
      <p>The time bounds stated below are all based on the assumption that evaluating an order predicate takes O(1) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Construction">Construction</h3><span class="monospace">(iset precedes? [element...])
</span>
      <p>Return a new set using the order predicate <span class="monospace">precedes?}}} and containing elements {{{element...}}}. If any subset of element arguments are equal according to {{{precedes?</span> then only the leftmost of them is a member of the returned set. Takes O(n log n) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Setqueries">Set queries</h3><span class="monospace">(iset? x)
(iset-empty? set)
(iset-size set)
(iset-order-predicate set)
</span>
      <p><span class="monospace">iset-size</span> may take O(n) time, though O(1) is optimal. The other procedures take O(1) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Setoperations">Set operations</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-union set...)
(iset-intersection set...)
(iset-difference left right...)
(iset-symmetric-difference left right...)
</span>
      <p>Return a new set containing the union/intersection/difference/symmetric difference of the arguments. All the arguments must be sets sharing an equivalent order predicate. Runs in O(kn log n) time, where k is the number of sets and n is the number of elements involved; O(kn) time is optimal.</p>
      <h3 id="Elementqueries">Element queries</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-member? set x)
</span>
      <p>Returns non-<span class="monospace">#false}}} iff {{{x}}} is an element of {{{set}}}, or {{{#false</span> otherwise. Takes O(log n) time.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-min set)
(iset-max set)
</span>
      <p>Returns the least/greatest element of <span class="monospace">set}}}. It is an error for {{{set</span> to be empty. Takes O(log n) time; O(1) is optimal.</p>
      <h3 id="Elementoperations">Element operations</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-update set x present-proc absent-proc)
</span>
      <p>A continuation-based universal element update procedure. Attemps to find an element <span class="monospace">y}}} equal to {{{x}}} in {{{set}}}. When such a {{{y</span> is found, calls</p><span class="monospace">(present-proc y update remove)
</span>
      <p>which must either tail-call</p><span class="monospace">(update new-y ret)
</span>
      <p>to replace <span class="monospace">y}}} with {{{new-y</span>, or tail-call</p><span class="monospace">(remove ret)
</span>
      <p>to remove <span class="monospace">y}}} from {{{set}}}. In either case {{{ret}}} will be returned from the enclosing {{{iset-update</span> call.</p>
      <p>When no such <span class="monospace">y}}} is found, {{{iset-update</span> calls</p><span class="monospace">(absent-proc insert ignore)
</span>
      <p>which should either tail-call</p><span class="monospace">(insert ret)
</span>
      <p>to insert <span class="monospace">x}}} into {{{set</span>, or else tail-call</p><span class="monospace">(ignore ret)
</span>
      <p>to leave <span class="monospace">set}}} unchanged. Again, {{{ret}}} will be returned from the enclosing {{{iset-update</span> call.</p>
      <p>In any case, <span class="monospace">iset-update</span> returns</p><span class="monospace">(values new-set ret)
</span>
      <p>where <span class="monospace">new-set}}} is a new set reflecting the indicated modification, if any; and {{{ret</span> is the return value produced by one of the continuations. It runs in O(log n) time.</p>
      <p>(This procedure is based on an analogous procedure for hash tables suggested by Alexey Radul and attributed to Taylor Campbell.)</p><span class="monospace">(iset-find iset x [absent-thunk])
</span>
      <p>Returns the element <span class="monospace">y}}} equal to {{{x}}} in {{{set}}}, or the result of evaluating {{{(absent-thunk)}}} if no such element exists. If {{{absent-thunk}}} is unspecified then a default procedure that always returns {{{#false</span> is used. Takes O(log n) time.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-include set x)
(iset-exclude set x)
</span>
      <p>Return a new set that certainly does/doesn't include <span class="monospace">x</span>. Each operation takes O(log n) time.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-predecessor set x [absent-thunk])
(iset-successor set x [absent-thunk])
</span>
      <p>Returns the element that immediately precedes/succeeds <span class="monospace">x}}} in {{{set}}}'s ordering. If no such element exists because {{{x}}} is the minimum/maximum element, or because {{{set}}} is empty, returns the result of evaluating {{{(absent-thunk)}}}. If {{{absent-thunk}}} is unspecified then a default procedure that always returns {{{#false</span> is used. Takes O(log n) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Rangequeries">Range queries</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-between set least include-least most include-most)
</span>
      <p>Returns a new set containing the elements of <span class="monospace">set}}} in the interval between {{{least}}} and {{{most}}}. If {{{include-least}}}/{{{include-most}}} is non-{{{#false}}} then the result includes elements equal to {{{least}}}/{{{most</span> respectively; otherwise those elements are not included. Takes O(k log k + log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the set and k is the number of elements returned; O(k + log n) is optimal.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-range&lt; set x)
(iset-range&lt;= set x)
(iset-range= set x)
(iset-range&gt;= set x)
(iset-range&gt; set x)
</span>
      <p>Returns a new set containing only the elements of <span class="monospace">set}}} that are less/less-or-equal/equal/greater-or-equal/greater than {{{x</span>. Takes O(k log k + log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the set and k is the number of elements returned; O(k + log n) is optimal.</p>
      <p>Note that since set elements are unique, <span class="monospace">iset-range=</span> returns a set of at most one element.</p>
      <h3 id="Filter,fold,map">Filter, fold, map</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-filter predicate? set)
</span>
      <p>Returns a new set containing only those elements <span class="monospace">x}}} for which {{{(predicate? x)}}} returns non-{{{#false</span>. Takes O(n log n) time; O(n) is optimal.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-fold proc base set)
</span>
      <p>The fundamental set iterator. Equivalent to, but may be more efficient than,</p><span class="monospace">(fold proc base (iset-&gt;ordered-list set))
</span>
      <p>Takes O(n) time.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-map/monotone proc set)
</span>
      <p>Returns a new set containing the elements <span class="monospace">(proc x)}}} for every {{{x}}} in {{{set}}}. {{{proc</span> must be a <i>monotone</i> unary procedure that preserves the order and uniqueness of set elements. Takes O(n) time.</p><span class="monospace">(iset-map proc set)
</span>
      <p>Returns a new set containing the elements <span class="monospace">(proc x)}}} for every {{{x}}} in {{{set}}}. {{{proc}}} must be a unary procedure, but is not required to be monotone, and so the result of the map operation may be out of order and may contain duplicates. When a subset of elements in {{{set</span> all map to the same result value, only the least of those elements is a member, in mapped form, of the resulting set. This operation is equivalent to, but may be more efficient than,</p><span class="monospace">(list-&gt;iset (set-order-predicate set) (map proc (set-&gt;ordered-list set)))
</span>
      <p>It takes O(n log n) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Conversion">Conversion</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-&gt;ordered-list set)
</span>
      <p>Returns a list containing the elements of <span class="monospace">set</span> in increasing order. Takes O(n) time.</p><span class="monospace">(ordered-list-&gt;iset precedes? list)
</span>
      <p>Returns a set containing the elements of <span class="monospace">list}}} and using order predicate {{{precedes?}}}. It is an error for {{{list</span> to be anything other than a proper list of elements in increasing order. Takes O(n log n) time; O(n) is optimal.</p><span class="monospace">(list-&gt;iset precedes? list)
</span>
      <p>Returns a set containing the elements of <span class="monospace">list}}} and using order predicate {{{precedes?}}}. {{{list}}} must be a proper list, but may contain duplicates and need not be in order. When a subset of input elements are equal according to {{{precedes?}}}, only the first such element in {{{list</span> is a member of the returned set. Takes O(n log n) time.</p>
      <h3 id="Elementcomparison">Element comparison</h3><span class="monospace">(iset-element&lt;? set x y)
(iset-element=? set x y)
(iset-element&gt;? set x y)
</span>
      <p>These procedures compare <span class="monospace">x}}} to {{{y}}} according to {{{set}}}'s order predicate and the conventional meaning of {{{&lt;}}}, {{{=}}}, and {{{&gt;</span>.</p>
