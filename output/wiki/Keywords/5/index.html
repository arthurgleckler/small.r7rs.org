      <p>There seems to be a serious issue with how we handle keywords (by which we mean, things like the <span class="monospace">else</span> in <span class="monospace">cond</span>). R5RS was vague on the matter, and each choice of implementation approach seems to have issues.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is <span class="monospace">syntax-rules</span> a keyword in this sense?  Some Schemes say yes, others no.</li></ul>
      <p>The R6RS standard decided to use explicitly exported and defined auxiliary syntax values, where every syntax-rules literals clause matched hygienically using <span class="monospace">free-identifier=?</span>.</p>
      <p>Let's summarise the issues with different approaches.</p>
      <h2 id="Keywordsassymbols"><a href="/wiki/Keywords">Keywords</a> as symbols</h2>
      <p>One approach is to say that the implementation of <span class="monospace">cond</span> must match a symbol called <span class="monospace">else</span> - so it's purely symbolic equality, rather than bothering about lexical environments.</p>
      <p>Problems: See this thread: http://lists.scheme-reports.org/pipermail/scheme-reports/2011-May/000632.html</p>
      <p>Particularly, symbolic equality bypasses the normal identifier equality tests used by <span class="monospace">syntax-rules</span>, thereby violating referential transparency and hygiene in some cases.</p>
      <h2 id="KeywordsasBindings"><a href="/wiki/Keywords">Keywords</a> as Bindings</h2>
      <p>Under this scheme, <span class="monospace">else</span> is bound to something (a value? a macro? a pineapple?) along with the definition of <span class="monospace">cond</span>, and we check that the same binding is in place when <span class="monospace">else</span> is used in the wild.</p>
      <p>This means that if we do:</p><span class="monospace">(let ((else #f))
(cond
     (else 1))
</span>
      <p>...we'll get an error, not 1, as we've rebound <span class="monospace">else</span>; that arm of the <span class="monospace">cond</span> will evaluate <span class="monospace">else</span> and get <span class="monospace">#f</span>, so no arm of the <span class="monospace">cond</span> matches.</p>
      <p>However, it has another issue. Andy Wingo, I believe, gave an example of a module that exposes both <span class="monospace">compile</span> (a procedure) and <span class="monospace">eval-when</span> (a macro that uses <span class="monospace">compile</span> as a keyword). It's then impossible to expose <span class="monospace">eval-when</span> into a sandbox, still able to use the <span class="monospace">compile</span> keyword, without then also giving them the <span class="monospace">compile</span> procedure. In this situation you can use keywords-as-symbols, as arbitrary expressions can never appear there; but in a case like <span class="monospace">cond</span>, it would be impossible to export <span class="monospace">cond</span> and all its functions without also exporting a procedure that happened to also be called <span class="monospace">else</span> or <span class="monospace">=&gt;</span>.</p>

      <p>Please add alternative implementation techniques here, and discuss their problems and characteristics.</p></div></body></html>
