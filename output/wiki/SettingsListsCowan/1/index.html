      <p>In this proposal, a filename passed to any of <span class="monospace">open-input-file</span>, <span class="monospace">open-binary-input-file</span>, <span class="monospace">open-output-file</span>, <span class="monospace">open-binary-output-file</span>, <span class="monospace">with-input-from-file</span>, <span class="monospace">with-output-from-file</span>, <span class="monospace">call-with-input-file</span>, and <span class="monospace">call-with-output-file</span> may be specified either as a string (as in R7RS-small) or as a <i>settings list</i>, which is a list of alternating <i>keys</i> and <i>values</i> where every key is a symbol.  <span class="monospace">Quasiquote</span> syntax is useful in creating settings lists.  Specifying a string is equivalent to specifying the settings list <span class="monospace">(path </span><i>string</i><span class="monospace">)</span>.  Implementations MUST support the following keys:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><span class="monospace">path</span></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the filename.  The interpretation of filenames is implementation-dependent.  There is no default value, but implementations MAY accept other keys in lieu of this one for opening files or file-like objects that don't have string names.  In particular, filenames on Posix are really u8-vectors with some u8 values excluded, and filenames on Windows are really u16-vectors with some u16 values disallowed, and while most names of actual files are representable as strings, some may not be.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">binary</span></dt>
        <dd>Specifies binary rather than textual operations.  If the value of this key is <span class="monospace">#t</span>, then a call to <span class="monospace">open-input-file</span> or <span class="monospace">open-output-file</span> is treated as a call to <span class="monospace">open-binary-input-file</span> or <span class="monospace">open-binary-output-file</span> respectively, and a call to <span class="monospace">with-input-from-file</span>, <span class="monospace">with-output-from-file</span>, <span class="monospace">call-with-input-file</span>, or <span class="monospace">call-with-output-file</span> is treated as if the underlying procedure were <span class="monospace">open-binary-input-file</span> or <span class="monospace">open-binary-output-file</span>.  It is an error to specify the value as <span class="monospace">#f</span> on calls to <span class="monospace">open-binary-input-file</span> or <span class="monospace">open-binary-output-file</span>; otherwise, the value <span class="monospace">#f</span> causes the key to be ignored.  </dd></dl>
      <p>Implementations SHOULD support the following additional keys (if not, then the implementation-dependent default cannot be changed):</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><span class="monospace">buffering</span></dt>
        <dd>Specifies what kind of buffering is present.  The value <span class="monospace">#f</span> means no buffering is employed; <span class="monospace">binary</span> means that there is a binary buffer but no character buffer; <span class="monospace">#t</span> means there are both character and binary buffering.  Other values MAY be specified by an implementation.  Buffer sizes are implementation-dependent.  The default value is implementation-dependent.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">encoding</span></dt>
        <dd>Specifies what character encoding to use on a binary port.  The (case insensitive) value <span class="monospace">US-ASCII</span> MUST be supported.  The values <span class="monospace">ISO-8859-1</span> and <span class="monospace">UTF-8</span> SHOULD be supported if the implementation contains the appropriate repertoire of characters.  Other values MAY be supported, which SHOULD appear in the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">IANA list of encodings</a>.  The default value is implementation-dependent.
If a BOM (Byte Order Mark, U+FEFF) is present at the beginning of input on a port encoded as UTF-8, it is skipped.  A BOM is not automatically written on output.  Implementations MAY provide a way around this.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">newline</span></dt>
        <dd>Specifies how to translate newlines.  The value <span class="monospace">#f</span> means that no translation is performed.  The value <span class="monospace">#t</span> causes all of CR, LF, CR+LF, NEL (U+0085), CR+NEL, and LS (U+2028) to be translated to <span class="monospace">#\newline</span> on input.  On output, the translation is implementation-dependent.  Other values MAY be specified by an implementation.  The default value is implementation-dependent.</dd>
        <dt><span class="monospace">case-sensitive</span></dt>
        <dd>Specifies if Scheme symbols are read (as by <span class="monospace">read</span>) from the port case-sensitively or not.  The value <span class="monospace">#f</span> means that upper-case letters in symbols are translated to lower case unless escaped; <span class="monospace">#t</span> means that no translation is done.  The default value is <span class="monospace">#t</span>.</dd></dl>
      <p>Implementations MAY support other keys, SHOULD warn if they detect keys they do not understand or implement, and MAY signal an error in such cases.</p></div></body></html>
