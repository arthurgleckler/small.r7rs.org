    <pre>== Input and output ==

The default value of ''port'' is the current input or output port, as appropriate.  It is an error if the ports passed to these procedures are not binary ports.  The [type] values are defined in BytevectorsCowan.

`(read-[type] ` [ ''port'' ]`)`

Reads the appropriate number of bytes from ''port'' and returns a number of the appropriate type (exact integer or inexact real or complex number).

`(write-[type] `''number'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

Writes ''number'' to ''port'' in the appropriate format.

`(read-ber-integer ` [ ''port'' ]`)`

Reads a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding BER]-encoded integer of arbitrary size from ''port'' and returns it as an exact integer.

`(write-ber-integer ` ''exact-integer'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

Writes ''exact-integer'' using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding BER] encoding to ''port''.

`(read-utf8-string ` ''k'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

`(read-utf16-le-string ` ''k'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

`(read-utf16-be-string ` ''k'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

Read ''k'' bytes from ''port'', interpreting them as a sequence of characters encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE, and return the sequence as a string.  It is an error if the implementation forbids any of the characters in strings.

`(write-utf8-string ` ''string'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

`(write-utf16-le-string ` ''string'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

`(write-utf16-be-string ` ''string' [ ''port'' ]`)`

Convert the characters of ''string'' to UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE, and write the bytes to ''port''.  It is an error if the implementation forbids any of the characters in strings.

`(read-utf8-string-until `''byte'' [ ''port'' ]`)`

Read bytes from ''port'' until a byte equal to ''byte'' is read.  Discard the final byte, interpret all the other bytes as a sequence of characters encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE, and return the sequence as a string.
